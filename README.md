# Luminoso Sales Engineering Code

## Usage Instructions
This script was recently upgraded to use `uv` for python management and some helper scripts for
a hopefully simpler workflow. 

The usage instructions for running the `bi_tool_export` command now are:

```sh
./setup.sh

./run_bi_tool_export.sh {other args}

# for instance
./run_bi_tool_export.sh --help
```


## Older Instructions

There is an older readme as well which documents the repository structure before these changes.
It is unclear how relevant the information contained in it is now, but may be useful for reference.
See `./README_old.md`
