When on shift we let down guests because we simply cannot be in enough places or doing enough things at once.   We need more staff and we need more flexibility in scheduling.

bathroom,1Question, Suggestions For Improvement,93.3595764992,1.10499662116e-26,88,3037,"Overall, Hilton Waikoloa is a great place to work.  My problem is with other departments.  We need to have a 12 hour laundry shift.  Rooms cannot be done with cleanliness as a factor because the housekeepers are leaving the rooms half done.  Missing towels, soap not replenished, carpet not vacuum, screens & furniture not dusted.  If the housekeeper has all her supplies (towels, linens, shower curtains, working vacuum, ect.) she could finish her room before jumping into another room.  Whenever the housekeeper needs to return to finish cleaning the room, it's time wasted.  This is where we drop service.  It all starts with Laundry.  A better TV/movie system is needed as the present one is too complicated for most guests to operate.","1. paid holidays (i.e. any team member working on a holiday should be compensated with holiday pay plus regular time pay)  2. improvements to guest rooms:  a. soundproofing rooms especially those that are prone to noise   b. the tubs/showers need remodeling - many of our guests do not like the bathroom. shower head too low, shower stall too small, stains, not modern  3. Front Desk/Lobby area to be remodeled  a. tiles on floor look work and dirty  b. restaurant space needs be separate from that of lobby space. it is unusual for guests to be told lobby space is reserved for restaurant seating/service",I feel that Housekeeping is the most important department to a hotel business. If your hotel is not up to standards or you don't have what you need when you travel your going to get a lot of angry guest and bad reviews and people will not stay at your hotel. We are a downtown hotel so when people book our hotel their expectations are higher then to them booking a hotel in our local areas. which we all as employees should understand that as well. Housekeeping is unorganized we need more staff in housekeeping it is starting to be overwhelming when you try to save money and overwork one individual in each section of housekeeping . sometimes it be so much laundry that needs to be clean and our machines half work or dryer machines are out and they do temporary fixes to get them back running. With our housekeepers you giving the girls a time limit to be done by the end of the day and the girls are doing basic cleaning rushing through the rooms an attend to forget things.We are all humans we can be forgetful and make mistakes but those mistakes could be prevented a lot if our housekeepers were not so overwhelmed an stressed due to the amount of rooms they are doing a day. Our rooms are not regular rooms as the other hotels we have suites which their is more space to detail clean more items as refrigerator and microwave to clean. In other hotels its just the room bathroom and bed. And they give you 14 credits. Its a difference. Plus the new rooms are more difficult than the older rooms cause now you have carpet and hardwood floors so you are doing double work on cleaning the new rooms with cleaning the floors. We need vinegar for the water stains because the water in the hotel is hard. we need to find what product would be best to use on the floors because our product is starting to discolor the floors that are being newly renovated. We need to have all items like soap laundry bags toilet paper shampoo conditioner lotion over stocked. So we don't run out during big events.,3125
suggest,1Question, Suggestions For Improvement,86.5697891174,0.0,1779,1083,"I would suggest for directors/top management to engage more with team members and take their thoughts/suggestions/needs into consideration.  If you read trip advisor/salt reviews or even go and talk to guests you will find out that they do not return to this property for our deteriorating and outdated furniture, they do not come back for our lack of supply, they do not come back for our overpriced food and drinks or outdated menu, they come back for THE EXCELLENT STAFF.  Time and time again guests mention how well they are treated by everyone from the front desk to the valet up to the pool and the restaurant.  Our great service is what leaves an impression on the guests and brings them back year after year.  With that being said, I feel that we should be valued and appreciated more.  Months ago management began an incentive program that was never followed through with, payments are not made or kept track of, we are not told when we are mentioned on surveys or reviews.  I believe management should always be keeping track when we are mentioned, read us the review that was left, hearing positive feedback like that boosts morale and encourages strong work ethic.  It is hard to have pride and confidence in our hotel without the encouragement, without the physical supplies as well.  We lack full table settings sometimes, lack proper restaurant staff, no host, no food runners, no bussers, it is embarrassing.  As a server I should not have to greet my table by starting with a list of things we don't have (sushi) or have to put a napkin under a table so it doesn't wobble.  So I would definitely suggest some more appreciation and consideration of our ideas.  We are the ones spending the most time with guests so we can best recommend what they would like to see more/less of, after all the guests are most important, right?","There are a couple of things that I would like to see improved. Medical benefits would be one, each year they get more and more expensive. I can't imagine team members making $10.00 per/hr with a family that need to be covered how they would pay for their benefits. Second thing is, I wish my direct manager was more of a leader and not just a boss. When things get busy he doesn't jump in to carry requisitions to not overwork the team he just piles it up on the recruiters, and suggest pertain able methods to cut processes and save time. It's easy for someone to tell the team how to do things and how to save time when they have never carried more than 2 - 8 requisitions.  When you have a team that is very dedicated and works very hard, and that constantly works more than 45 - 50 hrs a week and will not bill more than 40, just to get the job done and avoid dissatisfaction from our properties and HR partners there is a challenge. Direction from our manager and communication can be confusing at times, and for some reason it's put back on the team but if everyone on the team is misunderstanding what the manager is trying to deliver but then the manager just makes comments like ""why does everyone have to question and not just do what they are told""  it hurts the morale of the team. I've learned to just keep my opinions and suggestions to myself as I don't feel like my opinion matters. I hope that speaking my mind on this survey will not bring negative repercussions. I love my team and love working for Hilton as a company in itself is why I stay.","I have a few improvements that I would suggest. We are running several programs I disagree with one is FPG. It is a sales program. I understand we are in the business of making money and providing customer service. This program is asking customer service representatives to be salesman. I know as a guest the last thing I want to be is when checking into a hotel room and engaging the clerk about an upsell. If I wanted to be a salesman I would have gone into that field. It is a program that is really pushed hard here. The trainers are good don't get me wrong. I just think it is a misplaced program. I love the Kipsu idea of using emails or texts to communicate with guests. It is a great idea. It could be expanded into other areas, to provide promotional information in the future. I would also like to see if the managers at the hotel would be more concerned about training and staffing rather than their end of year budget so they can get there bonuses. Many times we are under staffed and our new hires are rushed along to quickly into the fire. Once in the job because of low staffing they are rushed along to quickly to get a body in the position. Our hiring process is slow. When we do get someone hired they are rushed into the job. They can struggle on the job. Have a manager talk to them about quality of work and then wither get rid of them or they quit. All due to lack of quality training. The materials are here at the hotel just not used effectively. Once employees go through the internet training programs they are thrown into the job. We here have limited trainers due to volume of work.     Our management here at the top is good. Our  front office director here is not good. Our morale is very poor. I have talked to most of the staff and we all feel the same way. We are overworked, under appreciated, under paid and afraid to say a thing. The repercussions at the hotel in our office is very bad.

chicken,1Question, Suggestions For Improvement,72.1414909312,1.61912681636e-20,68,247,"I would say that the hotel has poor food choices and our  employee café does not feel like a cafeteria. Their isn't much choices of food that the team members can choose from. I would like to see a hotline that has daily food choices like, hamburgers, hotdogs, subs, cheese sticks, curly fries, chicken sandwiches, grilled cheese, quesadilla. These items should be on our daily menu list to order to pick up, and I would not mind paying $5 dollars for that if it included a main course and two entrées. That would just be the team members second alternative incase we did like what was being served at the hotline. I would also like to see soft serve ice cream being served ( or some type of dessert).","I know that there is been modifications to our food options but I think we can do even better.  1. Ohana coffee: too much deep fried food. I know it tastes probably good but it kills us slowly too:) There are so many healthy alternatives witch tastes amazingly and easy to make as well. Our chefs need maybe a little training about healthy meals. For ex. grilled chicken/tofu instead of battered chicken or fish, sweet potatoes, coconut curries etc.  2. Grand Wailea food outlets: fresh fresh fresher food. I had a wrap at Bistro Molokini witch was not good at all, it was a veggie wrap and it did not feel fresh to me, like it was grilled maybe earlier in the day so the veggies were dry and flavorless.   Salads are very basic in a way that are easily made at home, for a luxury property we need some novelty, something we can get only at GW.","The employee cafeteria is slightly lacking. It would be nice to see more vegetarian or vegan options available-- healthy options and not just cheesy potatoes or grilled cheese. Also, more dressings in the salad bar would be nice-- hummus would be a great addition as well! Offering some sort of healthy grain such as quinoa or cous cous would be a plus! The food available in the evening is not always consistent and seems to be less than what is offered during the day. You should make soup a staple and always available to eat!

The Floors on 2nd and 4th floor back of the house should be as impeccable as the front of the house. Floors get very slippery(dangerous) and dirty, refrigerators have mold. If we have spills it's difficult to get a steward to help voluntarily, we usually have to find a manager to ask them to help. Supplies are never easily found. We usually have to contact a manager to have from paper cups to silverware available for us in anticipation. Service Trays are never in one place, we have to search for them all around both floors. We travel up and down (2nd-4th floor) for supplies from runners, to decorations, risers, plates, silverware, mugs glasses, silverware,milk etc. Sometimes we have juice only on 4th floor or water only on 2nd floor. Cocktail napkins always have to be requested. All silverware and glasses should be washed better, they don't only have water stains but food stuck on them. We find glasses in need of rewashing 80% of the time. Our Carts are Filthy!!  We use these carts to bring food to buffets, banquet waiters should not be dealing with chemichals when we have to serve food. Our runners are stained and old (embarrassing). We find coffee machines off which can cause us to be late on coffee stations. These machines shouls never be off, they take over 30 minutes to heat up and very ready to brew, this can cause us to not be ready on time.  We need better uniforms as well, the quality of the fabric is very uncomfortable (itchy). They also are very delicate, pants rip very easily because they are not flexible at all. They are too hot for the summer, a lighter version for hotter months should be provided as an alternative.","We often find ourselves complaining about dirty glassware and mentioned to managers seval times. All of our new wine glasses keep coming out very dirty with dried soap on them or champagne glasses full fo dried orange juice pulp. We are already suffering from labor so having to send back the dirty glassare to get it replaced for new ones is only making things worse.We dont have time to wait for the new ones to arrive and yet they still arrive dirty.This wasnt an issue before, now we have to try and polish them before placing them on the table. It is very timeconsuming and we clearly dont have the staff or time.Agter bringing this up the respond we got from Jose Galindo is that they changed the soap to a cheaper one to save money. Dirty silverware is also ian issue when it is delivered to us. They are often sticky, oily, with food. Heatlamps delivered dirty or not working.Our equipment should be ready and in decent conditions for us to simply arrive and start settting up. We shouldnt be dealing with sending it back or calling stewards over to clean or fix the items. Equipment should arrive clean and ready for us to succeed.This same issue is happening with our banquet white napkins, out of a stack of 100 napkins around hald of them will be an off white color almost like a faded yellow.We have a server seperate them and look through piles to look for the nice white ones. We also barely have enough carts becouse whatever we have, our manager seems to lend them to every other department for them and we stay with nothing or left with broken ones. Again, no time to be running around looking for carts. They seem to throw that responsibility on us instead of them being more strict with our equipment. Our Banquet office is so crowded.Theres so many safety issues in there and this has been a problem since we moved in there.You all know about it.

If your hotel is not up to standards or you don't have what you need when you travel your going to get a lot of angry guest and bad reviews and people will not stay at your hotel. We are a downtown hotel so when people book our hotel their expectations are higher then to them booking a hotel in our local areas. which we all as employees should understand that as well. Housekeeping is unorganized we need more staff in housekeeping it is starting to be overwhelming when you try to save money and overwork one individual in each section of housekeeping . sometimes it be so much laundry that needs to be clean and our machines half work or dryer machines are out and they do temporary fixes to get them back running. With our housekeepers you giving the girls a time limit to be done by the end of the day and the girls are doing basic cleaning rushing through the rooms an attend to forget things.We are all humans we can be forgetful and make mistakes but those mistakes could be prevented a lot if our housekeepers were not so overwhelmed an stressed due to the amount of rooms they are doing a day. Our rooms are not regular rooms as the other hotels we have suites which their is more space to detail clean more items as refrigerator and microwave to clean. In other hotels its just the room bathroom and bed. And they give you 14 credits. Its a difference. Plus the new rooms are more difficult than the older rooms cause now you have carpet and hardwood floors so you are doing double work on cleaning the new rooms with cleaning the floors. We need vinegar for the water stains because the water in the hotel is hard. we need to find what product would be best to use on the floors because our product is starting to discolor the floors that are being newly renovated. We need to have all items like soap laundry bags toilet paper shampoo conditioner lotion over stocked. So we don't run out during big events.,the mens employee bathroom/locker room is horrible. i cannot stress how bad it is. it isnt the cleanliness its the size.  for the amount of men that work here there is nowhere near enough lockers to accomidate everyone in one shift let alone the entire property. and they are only suppoised to be for one shift yet everyone locks their stuff in there over night always.  im stuck having to carry around 40lbs of gear with me everywhere i go. it really is the worst part about working here. to add insult to injury the female co-workers have relayed just how large their locker room and bathroom situation is. how is this not sexual discrimination?,3128

I also think benefits should be offered to part time employees who work a minimum number of hours and have been here for a specified length of time.

I believe I have the reasoning to back up my claim. As a skilled employee with a four year degree in my field and years of experience on the job I have worked toward positions with wages above minimum wage. Minimum wage continues to increases throughout our state so does the cost of living. I have seen my monthly expenses increase hundreds of dollars over the last year and my wages remain the same whereas my colleagues working entry level position have seen drastic pay increases.

Our staffed is completely undermanaged. It's a free for all. We have many co-workers who get away with doing close to nothing and leave a mess wherever they lounge.

They won't address the situation at all. Not even to, at the very least, encourage these individual to do their job. This, ultimately, creates hostility among us. Stewarding is a disaster.

salary increase,1Question, Suggestions For Improvement,35.6463837542,8.83691997175e-46,172,4830,"An increase in the cap would be great! Some of us have chose our career path at Hilton that also meets the flexibility for our home life needs which means staying at our current job level. I have been at Hilton for years but then reached the cap and even though I exceed expectations every year, I only receive 1 bonus check instead of an increase in my pay rate. I would prefer the raise over the bonus as we are taxed quite a bit on bonuses. Also the cost of living increases do not keep up with my salary that is never increased.","I think we deseve a higher pay rate based on  the added roles we have been taking on (customer service, redemption, etc.) Also the cost of living has increased drastically, pay has not improved. We are only afforded one small raise each year without the ability to increase more than 3.5%.  I also think benefits should be offered to part time employees who work a minimum number of hours and have been here for a specified length of time. Healthcare costs are skyrocketing making it unaffordable. This would help employees and also help the company retain valuable employees who may opt to leave and go to companies who offer this. It would also entice new employees to stay with the company knowing they may be eligible in future.","The only thing I would suggest is salary increases in annual review as well as cost of living raise. In my 10 years, I have yet to see a cost of living raise for my department, while reservations and customer care have received this type increase other departments have not. I would increase based on cost of living as well as percentage. A .31 cent an hour a year is very sad for consistency in winning CTE with almost 100% in every category, every quarter. At minimum an increase to at least .50 an hour on yearly review. With an almost perfect score,  I only ranked at meets instead of consistently exceeds. Process needs to be reviewed.",5002

Divided kitchens are not made to breathe good environment everything would be easier and more profitable for the company (with the same ambitions ).

He invents reasons why we do not get our evaluations on time. There are currently Security Officers who are still ""waiting"" to receive their evaluations after many years of service.

""I don't know what happened to them, but I turned them in.""  When we have gone and asked Human Resources for updates on the evaluations, Human Resources informs us that they have not received anything from our Director. This has been going on for many years and we have brought this up to the attention of Human Resources on many occasions but there are no changes.

We currently have many associates that have not received any evaluations and are simply being lied to by our Director in order to not give them a pay increase and have him (our Director) look good on paper because of the low budget. (This is actually the associates money that is simply being put into our Director's pocket year after year when he gets his yearly bonus and recognition which makes it illegal and immoral).    Suggestion: Give the associates their yearly evaluations",5

I believe that it is very important to have a relationship where employees can come to HR in order to get help, advice, and assistance.  Over the past few years there has been conflict between the two, which in my opinion, has added more resistance in the hotel overall.  They have made promises and not kept them, supported Howard Wein and Associates (a contracted business to renovate and help manage the hotel that was hired by the hotel owners), over Hilton employees and company values.  Over the past year, since Howard Wein has finished renovating the hotel, there has been improvement, however, there are still ongoing issues with renewing the union contract regarding benefits that employees would like to continue to keep.  The affordability of healthcare is very important to employees that don't make a salary.",331

Our staffed is completely undermanaged. It's a free for all. We have many co-workers who get away with doing close to nothing and leave a mess wherever they lounge. They take very little pride in their work, and consequently, our guests suffer. There aren't any consequences because HR doesn't make any effort to investigate these individuals. They won't address the situation at all. Not even to, at the very least, encourage these individual to do their job. This, ultimately, creates hostility among us. Stewarding is a disaster. They are understaffed and overworked. They have very little structure. They don't know how to clear the work area and set up a proper break down. We don't have staff to consolidate buffet food on large events. The food and work area becomes an absolute mess very quickly. We don't have proper work equipment to execute our job.

Everyone I talk to seems to be stressed to a certain degree from issues we have. First off is the renovation. I know that it is a struggle to keep everyone happy, but the company that has done the renovation has made so many mistakes and that has greatly affected the desk staff. Guests come to us with their complaints and we have to try to resolve these issues. I feel like the renovation process has just been executed very poorly and Hilton hasn't seemed to step in and intervene to help, which is disappointing. Another issue we constantly face is cleanliness of the property itself, this one is just getting to the point of being ridiculous. We get sooo many complaints from guests in house and through the SALT surveys. This is something that could be fixed but it doesn't seem to be happening. This is probably one of the most irritating issues this property is facing right now. The newly renovated rooms are having complaints due to not properly being cleaned. You can go in there and see dried drywall paste and putty on the walls and floors. I've also had it happen many times that guests do not have the supplies that should be in there at check in, i.e. hairdryers, conditioner, shampoo, and soap. This is a huge oversight at this level of a property. I've been told it's due to budget, which is not a good excuse. If you have to go over budget to buy the necessities then do it. We should not be running out of soap, shampoo, toilet paper, tooth paste, and other basic supplies. I get the same complaint from the kitchen. They say they don't have the supplies they need like eggs, milk, creamers and other such items due to budget and I find this to be ridiculous. Of the hotels I've worked at, this has not been an issue. It's things like what's mentioned above that has the staff at the desk at a low morale. Management needs to learn to listen to complaints from the desk so we can do our jobs without the stress.","Have security and/or guard at entrance 24/7... it will eliminate a lot of problems such as: homeless coming in the hotel urinating in bathrooms or stairs, clientele who don't have guest suites but use facilities such as pool and comp services such as breakfast, evening reception.

It also creates a  parking problem because there are a lot of non-registered cars. In addition they constantly break the gate pole, so there is free entrance to everyone.   There has been many fights and calls to the police because the trouble that this type of clientele creates.  The hotel is going through renovation and is investing a lot of money in new look. PLEASE CONSIDER TO INVEST IN A SECURITY GUARD at entrance, so this type of clientele won't destroy the new renovated hotel or chase away the guests that are paying for their accommodations.  There is no security at all at this hotel... would hate for something bad to happen so management will finally react and have security up front/entrance to control entrance and exit.","This building is in serious need of renovations, it is the only issue that both the employees and the guests seem to have.

Even if they get a guest suite they invite the whole neighborhood and have more than 6 people in guest suite (8, 10, 20) creating an excessive work for housekeeping (cleaning rooms), breakfast (long lines), evening reception (long lines) and destroying the rooms ... leaving stains in carpet, etc ... not only that but in addition steeling pillows, blankets, towels from pool/guest suites, etc. If they use F&B outlets, they don't tip or find a way to complaint so they can get a free meal.  It also creates a  parking problem because there are a lot of non-registered cars. In addition they constantly break the gate pole, so there is free entrance to everyone.   There has been many fights and calls to the police because the trouble that this type of clientele creates.  The hotel is going through renovation and is investing a lot of money in new look.

More sharing of information and best practices would make us stronger.

Because we might lose one or two leads?  We are failing to realize our full potential.  Let's make a collective agreement that every Hilton-managed hotel in Chicago is copied on every lead every time.        Second, the different levels of access to information and insight are staggering across the properties.

housekeeping,Brand, Embassy Suites,2.12939558585,1.0814103645e-05,469,1829,I feel that Housekeeping is the most important department to a hotel business. If your hotel is not up to standards or you don't have what you need when you travel your going to get a lot of angry guest and bad reviews and people will not stay at your hotel. We are a downtown hotel so when people book our hotel their expectations are higher then to them booking a hotel in our local areas. which we all as employees should understand that as well. Housekeeping is unorganized we need more staff in housekeeping it is starting to be overwhelming when you try to save money and overwork one individual in each section of housekeeping . sometimes it be so much laundry that needs to be clean and our machines half work or dryer machines are out and they do temporary fixes to get them back running. With our housekeepers you giving the girls a time limit to be done by the end of the day and the girls are doing basic cleaning rushing through the rooms an attend to forget things.We are all humans we can be forgetful and make mistakes but those mistakes could be prevented a lot if our housekeepers were not so overwhelmed an stressed due to the amount of rooms they are doing a day. Our rooms are not regular rooms as the other hotels we have suites which their is more space to detail clean more items as refrigerator and microwave to clean. In other hotels its just the room bathroom and bed. And they give you 14 credits. Its a difference. Plus the new rooms are more difficult than the older rooms cause now you have carpet and hardwood floors so you are doing double work on cleaning the new rooms with cleaning the floors. We need vinegar for the water stains because the water in the hotel is hard. we need to find what product would be best to use on the floors because our product is starting to discolor the floors that are being newly renovated. We need to have all items like soap laundry bags toilet paper shampoo conditioner lotion over stocked. So we don't run out during big events.,"I suggest the housekeeping supervisors to take care of calls that are towards housekeepers. many simple tasks are stacked on house mans constantly and they don't have the time to tell the housekeepers which rooms need service, checking out, staying over, etc.",easy carts to push (housekeeping)  upgrade rooms  more laundry rooms as ice machines,2298

It is frustrating to see this be allowed and makes you not want to give your all because you may be the only person doing it. Pool towels!!!!!! I get asked all day long on something I have no control over. Possibly have an overnight laundry attendent to stay up on all laundry so we never run out of towels. This is unacceptable for a resort like this. We should also have the basic supplies to do our job. It is not efficient to have to try and run to get things that we need week after week. Run out of things too often.,"The morale at this property has been pretty low for a while. Everyone I talk to seems to be stressed to a certain degree from issues we have. First off is the renovation. I know that it is a struggle to keep everyone happy, but the company that has done the renovation has made so many mistakes and that has greatly affected the desk staff. Guests come to us with their complaints and we have to try to resolve these issues. I feel like the renovation process has just been executed very poorly and Hilton hasn't seemed to step in and intervene to help, which is disappointing. Another issue we constantly face is cleanliness of the property itself, this one is just getting to the point of being ridiculous. We get sooo many complaints from guests in house and through the SALT surveys. This is something that could be fixed but it doesn't seem to be happening. This is probably one of the most irritating issues this property is facing right now. The newly renovated rooms are having complaints due to not properly being cleaned. You can go in there and see dried drywall paste and putty on the walls and floors. I've also had it happen many times that guests do not have the supplies that should be in there at check in, i.e. hairdryers, conditioner, shampoo, and soap. This is a huge oversight at this level of a property. I've been told it's due to budget, which is not a good excuse. If you have to go over budget to buy the necessities then do it. We should not be running out of soap, shampoo, toilet paper, tooth paste, and other basic supplies. I get the same complaint from the kitchen. They say they don't have the supplies they need like eggs, milk, creamers and other such items due to budget and I find this to be ridiculous. Of the hotels I've worked at, this has not been an issue. It's things like what's mentioned above that has the staff at the desk at a low morale. Management needs to learn to listen to complaints from the desk so we can do our jobs without the stress.",2079

How can you expect to get honest feedback?","Bellman/valet should receive an hourly pay increase. The reason being that Austin has a HUGE cost of living. the cheapest one bedroom apartments in the area are around 1000 average. Earing 6$ an hr, after taxes and especially after dental and insurance, my monthly wage is around 680$ Now that Uber and Lyft have returned the shuttle is being used much less frequently. Some nights bellman/valet only make 10-20$ total in tips. Over the summer our tips dropped tremendously. When you have a night where you only make 10-20$ in tips, that averages out to around 7 something an hour. Usually when tips are this low they continue for weeks this way.   If the bellman's wages were increased to say at least 10$ an hour I can GUARANTEE the moral and happiness of the bellman/valet would change drastically. There have been many days where we all are extremely upset/worried about rent etc... An hourly increase would do wonders.","The minimum wage is increasing yearly till 2020, reaching $15 per hour in California.  I believe the wage in certain positions that required more experience and have more responsibilities should coincide with the yearly minimum wage increase as well as annual performance wage increase.  As of now only lower tier positions receive minimum wage compensation plus annual performance increase.  If this continues as is.  by 2020 a newly hired cashier can make as much as someone in a lead/supervision position that has been with the company several years.      Also highly suggested is holiday pay,  we work in a industry that work all year round.

Another thing that could make this hotel better is a guest laundry mat.",I wish we can move gradually to freshly cooked food items for breakfast and dinner.,"better food quality for the guests and team members. I've read a lot of opinions in which our guests complain about the food either from the breakfast or from the restaurant later in the afternoon and as for the team members' food it could improve a lot and  we're not even asking for a fancy menu, something simple, but well done.    And also the cleaning. Houskeeping does a good job, but they can do it better, they just got to put extra attention on some details like not leaving loose hairs after they clean up the rooms or checking if there are not any items that the previous guest left in the fridge.",4750

A cost of living increase every five years or so, beyond our usual annual increase, might go a long way in retaining staff.

front office,Brand, Hilton,1.63359177044,3.24940220295e-05,292,9017,"I cannot trust the Security Director. I cannot trust the Human Resources Director. I cannot trust the Hotel Manager.     All three are ineffective and untrustworthy leaders. All three prefer to stay away from other hotel employees.     All three prefer to be secluded in their offices and don't appear to socialize with other employees. A new position called ""safety manager"" opened up and the security director never mentioned it to the department staff.     There was no posting of the new opening posted in the office to tell the department that the department had a management position opened. I believe that the position was specifically designed and made for a security supervisor named Kerry. Kerry holds a ""supervisor"" title but does not supervise. Her title and position is a waste of company money. She is suppose to supervise the shift but she does not. The morning shift has a junior officer supervise in the event of the absence of the team.     There have been TOO MANY employees that got offered to resign when they should've been fired. Security Guard David Ramos stole guest property but was offered to resign by the security director.    A housekeeper stole guest property, quitted when confronted, and is now back at work. The guest and the police arrived at the houseman's home and they discovered that the houseman had the guest's property at the houseman's home. The employee is now back at work.    A front office manager stole from the hotel and disneyland desk but was offered to resign.    A front office manager criminally allowed a non guest to use a guest key to stay in a fake hotel room and the incident led to a criminal investigation. The manager was allowed to quit.    A bar staff stole money out of a guest wallet and when confronted he quit.    These employees should have been fired! They should have been fired and not given a chance to reemploy with the Hilton company. One manager now works for a Hilton property and the other works for another Hilton property.     Unethical!","I feel that the front service managers need to be replaced with the exceptions of Ghokan, Orville, and Bryan. The rest of these managers we have are unapproachable including our front office director Krystal Eng, she does not have an open door policy as she claims and is always very busy. I also feel that human resources is not a fair and approachable place. When you go down there with an issue they are always busy or claim that they will get back to you and never do. They start investigations that they never finish and they are one sided. They don't look at the employee as an equal they look at more as us versus them. The only Human resources person who I've seen time and time again treat everyone fairly is Jedlyn. Jillian has been reported by many departments  to be unfair and one sided but nothing has been done and no apology has been given to any of the people who have reported her.   I also feel that the moral at the hotel is gone. ITs all about the money that can be made here and not how we can actually service the guest. I also know that money is being stolen at the front desk and rates are being changed and management is aware and nothing is being done. We have an employee who actually got caught before and was told she could no longer work the front desk and she is actually working the desk as we speak on overtime, she was also chosen as a pride award nomanie and her name is clara bido. How can you have these types of people chosen for pride. She is still dong her thing and nothing is done. THese are only glimps of whats going on at the front desk.   Hilton really needs to send there own people here , clean house and fix all these issues because at the rate that we are going this is only going to be woest. they need to clean all these mangers out and also look into whats going on at this desk.","I Like team work and MANAGEMENT OF GENERAL MANAGER, HR DIRECTOR,   AND FRONT OFFICE MANAGER.",9309

However, in this modern time equipment and manning go hand in hand to ensure the most efficient and effective way of working. The current situation of equipment in Hilton is sadly very very bad. For one of the top ten hotel in KL and Malaysia, not having the proper equipment to do our work is really a huge blow to the brand name and Hilton should be ashamed of it. Every single day of my working day here in Hilton, I have to struggle with the equipment that i have. Many unnecessary hours have been put in just because we dont have the basic equipment needed. For example, plastic wrap!, blender, chopping board!, an oven!, knifes, just to name a few.

Head of department needs to be real leader and show example. At this property some of them are just as a tick in box and Human resources do not do anything about it. Weak Human resource interaction. It is just words about great leadership. What do you do to make senior managers actually be leaders who inspires their managers and other team members.... Nothing!!! Sad. Size of this property it is hard to be engaged. Give team equipment to work with, give Uniforms. Seems reception team are only ones who deserves new uniforms.... Contractors are treated bad. they still work with us and are here for our guests, but we do not care about them. Seems Hilton head office doesn't think Housekeeping has any problems, as most hotels have outsourced teams. Constantly short of staff, year to year. Out of last 10 years, last 3-4 years became worse than ever. You want SALT results, but pay Room attendants peanuts and Supervisors are overloaded with work, low pay and not motivated. Head of department are just here to sit in office and wait for others to do job. She is rude and never cares about her team. She should take example of her deputy. Here is no team work, WGC work for them, Hilton is separate. what has happened here? Looks like General manager even do not see that this department is falling apart, no people who can clean rooms, supervisors barley speak English, no proper training, team is with low moral and upset. How you can ask us to give you results, if basic things as pens get cancelled on orders, do duvets, no pillows, no equipment for room attendants to clean better and mainly no innovation in department. What ever you suggest goes no where- Judith is not taking it, if it is not her idea.

Also he seems to talk bad about other employee's a lot and doesn't handle situation professionally, I have already gone and talk to HR about a situation that has happened between him and I already. There are a few employees here that seem to not being open to ideas or suggestion and a lot of times we don't have all the equipment or supplies we need to do our jobs.

I am constantly having to rush around the uniform room looking for any pants I can wear on shifts. a lot of the shirts also have huge holes in the arm pits and some days I have noticed people wearing black jeans fro home or no apron because there is such a shortage.  Quite often we are short on staff. we usually have to get people in from catering to cover busy shifts or cover sick days which makes it uncomfortable and stressful calling in sick because you feel like you don't want to let the team down.,"First of all, I enjoy my job. Unfortunately, the pay is exceptionally low and the health benefits offered are under-whelming and very expensive for such a low paying job. My aunt called me to let me know that Taco Bell was hiring for 12.50 an hour and my daughter makes more working for Starbucks. I actually expected much more from Hilton. It is such a well known brand that I was sadly surprised. The travel benefits and the time off offered is really good!     Another area for critique would be the uniforms. When hired on, there weren't actually enough uniforms available to be assigned. The one shirt I did receive was of good quality, easy to wash and dry with a crisp presentable look. When I did receive the additional shirts, they actually need to be ironed daily to make them look presentable. Not sure why anyone would issue wool skirts as a uniform either. They are not user friendly, requiring drycleaning or at least a cold wash with a line dry. There is more upkeep required. The drycleaning offered by the hotel only goes out every few days and I have heard you may or may not get your items back in a timely matter. As I wear clean clothing on a daily basis, it would just be so much easier to receive a user friendly uniform or provide my own skirt or pants. I would also say I am surprised that I often see uniforms in all departments that are in need of repair or are in need of cleaning/pressing. In my experience, that first impression is so important. If we look good then people will immediately assume that we are good. if we don't meet there expectations as a first impression then it is a uphill push to convince them that everything that follows will be good!  Just a thought...    In my third area of observations... I really appreciate the lunch provided by the Hilton. I would say that the cafeteria often appears unclean, including the floors, tables, and at times the dinnerware. The food is at times tasty and other times it has been over cooked, has sat too long.",1141

I feel like there is no point in working hard because others dont have to and they dont have any consequences for it and others have to pick up their slack with no thanks or anything. The workload is very unfair like that and senior leaders will just choose to give the harder jobs to the older staff and make them work harder and lazy or unbright staff get simple easy jobs.   Talking to other staff, everyone is losing motivation because their efforts aren't appreciated and forced to work harder than others. Whats the point in trying when others don't have to. It also leads to double handling as MEP has to be rechecked and redone because someone else cant even do it. It gets very frustrating and you get annoyed at each other  There is also a lot of negativity through the management team, as they don't thank or appreciate the staff that they rely on to pick up slack. There are too many leaders on the floor at times, especially afternoon when  the night leaders come in. They all stand around and talk while watching us work instead of doing anything to help  There has also been a lot of catty behaviour and childish rumours beign spread throughout the departments and all levels of staff are involoved. It can seriously affect the team work and morale of staff to the point where people dont talk to eachother.   There needs to be a better way to hire better staff and/or follow up on their work to ensure they are pulling their weight. A better recognition system also should be put in place for those who actually work hard and can be trusted with complex jobs. We shouldnt be babysitting eachother.

It has happened numerous times and I have always double checked to ensure I have sent the correct dates in my emails prior to the roster being made and there has not been one single time when I have gotten it wrong. Sometimes it is not corrected and I feel as though I am missing opportunities for shifts as a result, to the point where I am looking for an additional job to make up the hours.

Poor performers are rewarded with as many shifts as high performers due to the concept of 'equal rostering time'. team members are regularly recruited when there are already insufficient shifts available for existing team members, and persons who are unavailable are rewarded with weekend shifts by specifying 'only available weekends'. Time between shifts minimum according to EBA is routinely ignored by management without consultation with staff, e.g. 2400 finish followed by an 0800 start.",Need extra Staff / more fulltime  Flexibility with Rostering and Requested leave    Managing poor performance in other departments so we can work together better as a whole,"It is a privilege to work for the Hilton Brisbane and the Hilton logo.    Improvements I would suggest are:    Contact with management; opinions seem to matter very little. Management appears to listen to team members and you believe they are going to take on board what is said, however, there are no changes. When brought up multiple times, the issues/topics, it feels as if you are being a hindrance to management. When discussing with management about rostering it is said that the balance between work and life is positive because of the hours over a fortnight or a month. However, this is not the case as the shifts are inconsistent within the pay week therefore leaving many team members who are not on salary or as financially savvy on the backfoot, in an economic decline because of inconsistent work. It is then said unto these workers to get a second job or work within other departments. This is not always so easy, from my own experience, balancing two or more jobs can be difficult.  There have been some team members promised higher duty training and more consistent hours time and time again and then they do not hear about it for weeks and even months. The benefits of such training and more consistent hours may seem as a poor financial investment for the hotel but this is only a short term result. If more team members were trained to handle more work it would be far more beneficial in the long term.  After mentioning training I believe I should say; initial and on the job training in my department is lacking to a horrible extent.   It also feels as if a poor work ethic is almost rewarded as people who offer a full availability are given the same amount of shifts as those who offer maybe 2 days. I understand that there are wages and costs to include but all of my hard work goes unrewarded and unnoticed.     I feel that the Hilton Brisbane to me is more than just a job, as I want to keep improving and ""Thrive"" but I find it very difficult when I feel so unwanted.",697

I totally understand why we have our own commercial services team for China and we need local team members to drive initiatives. This however is now being taken out of context and we have senior leaders from other functions that seems to promote a witch hunt for non local team members. I am myself getting more and more non local team member coming to me almost with a feeling of job insecurity because they are non local. To me, if we keep the ""In China for China"" on the commercial aspect then it is the right course but if we start creating a company culture in China that non local team member are not welcome, then we actually go against the Hilton value. I feel if we don't change the course of the direction in the past few month, especially driven by HR, Hilton will just become another local company and not a best place to work.    The other comment I would give is about non facing customer functions which seems to not realize they work for an hospitality company. Finance and HR are the great example of function which seems to really not understand that we are in the industry of serving other people and that it applies to everyone in the company, not only customer facing team members at hotel. As I said in my previous comment, this all comes down from senior leadership so it's about how these functions are being driven but when you have functions so reluctant to any change, not understand the millennial generation now in our company and overall not so willing to help others, we again go against our goal to become a great place to work.    Finally I think there is a huge need to Emotional Intelligence roll out within our company and up to senior leadership. It's really quite unbelievable how some leaders react, write email or just communicate with our team members. It comes from them still living in the 80s and not understand the greatest asset of a leader today is EQ.",I enjoy the interaction I have with the team and like the way they challenge me and give feedback. The culture within the hotel is great and I feel and am proud to be part of the team.

He should be with the staff if any urgent work needs to be done, but he at home and the staff in office till late night breaking their head on the task. Most of the staff is desperate to move out of this property because of such behaviour. Does not favour the staff in any ways.

Always late and cleared early, not replenished, and the quality of the food used to be average, but has got so bad recently.  Chefs do not care about vegetarian option, or giving 2 choices at least.  They make random food in one big pot which is mixed food types that no one is used to eating.  Tends to be worse at weekends and evenings when no managers are around..

In lunch time the tables belong to Dynasty, in dinner time they belong to Metropolitan Grill. This is confusing to costumers as there have been frequent cases in which the workers of Dynasty were called by costumers in Metropolitan Grill, which caused inconvenience to the workers. It would be better if there is a partation between the two places, and it will be more efficient to decide where those 4 tables belong to instead of sharing them.","Working at Dynasty, I think it is very unique how the restaurant is situated, where there are no walls among the other restaurants in the second floor (Metropolitan Grill, Junisoh, etc.). I understand the purpose of situating the restaurants in such way. However I think the negative points override the positive points. Considering how there is also a big stair case in the middle of the floor, it can get loud and the sounds echo especially since the Marble Lounge on the first floor has lots of customers during the day. Also, it may be confusing for the customers as they might not know which server to call for (especially in the middle tables shared by the Grill).","In my opinion, Dynasty should improve the team member concept by helping each other.

Also I think restaurant staff is being overworked. Minimize overttime hours and abolish the long-and-short shift system, because it messes up the circadian rhythm of the body when they're being played around like that by making them work irregular hours a day, which will lead to lower work satisfaction and higher worker turnover (which will lead to hiring new people, lower efficiency due to training new people).

After talk bout 10mins between my sister and HR,they ask me to go 1 of the specialist hospital BUT they didn't come and settle any papers at the counter. I paid deposit used my own money. And now after 2 yrs, they asked me to pay RM2600 without any breakdown. So where my benefits? why didn't tell me earlier what I entitle and what I'm not entitle.","Please recognize by practicing standardized bonus, proper panel clinics/hospitals, more dental benefits & sensible increment.",17

Although the admin team members in HR try their maximum to satisfy the team, the policies and practices of HR seniors does not make it easy for them to do this. A few examples: (1) HR seniors are very distant from team members apart from just wishing team members on rare occasions when they happen to physically see them, (2) Alcohol selling/buying and consumption in public for locals in Conrad Maldives is strictly prohibited by an HR policy. SOP is very strictly adhered by most of the team members, but sad to see local HR seniors consuming alcohol very openly in team member gatherings and are supportive to other team members by their behaviour to follow the same, and (3) HR seniors are at times too autocratic and bossy that team members do not feel getting back to them for help. Team members have become very hostile towards HR team, particularly to leaders there.  In order to build trust and confidence within team HR need to make improvements on these areas.  For me and many team members it is highly frustrating that GTMS survey has also got rid of HR related questions and on this survey there are hardly anything that many team members wish to express about Human Resources team.

I hope that my suggestion will be accomplished as has been in the past.     Well to tell you the truth, is that whenever there will be a promotion from one department to another, it will be always given to a foreigner than to a local employee. Sometimes it is fair enough. I have never complained about this, but from time to time, you will begin to realize this.   Lets talk about Front Office: if the head of department is foreign, then he prefers to have someone of his nationality.  The same thing happened in the main bar, in the Quarterdeck Bar.  Even in the Business Center, happened the same.     I am not complaining, but our clients that have been coming from the past, and kept their loyalty towards Hilton Malta, are realizing that there no other option, when asking about Malta, any local news, and new happenings. In the past they used to ask directly in the reception, but nowadays they have to ask at the Concierge.    Even between us we cannot express our feelings. We were told to speak in English, which is natural for us, and we did obey. But when other staff like Bulgarians, Hungarians, Philippines meet, they talk to each other in their language, which we cannot understand. But we Maltese were ordered not to speak with our local language.     Last thing is about the promotions given. I talked it over. Because there is more foreigners in the management team, they prefer to give a promotion to other foreigners, like in the restaurant, room service, business centre, housekeeping, executive lounge and also in the Bars section.

Starting off from the General Manager, right to the bottom of the hierarchy, everyone works hard to create a friendly and open environment which respects everyone. Even though our General Manager,is new, he goes out of his way to listen to the employees and treat them fairly and kindly. This is a very important trait of senior management and it is well exhibited by our present General Manager at Hilton Auckland. He is a very humble person and this enables people to be easily approachable to him.   There are a lot of benefits offered by Hilton to its employees especially HR who works actively to support, appreciate and encourage employees towards achieving their goals and providing opportunities to embark on cross training but understanding employee skills and abilities. Through these initiatives that HR does, Hilton employees are able to manage their stress effectively. The HR department is a strong and lively as it is because of the current Human Resource Director at Hilton Auckland.  She is a very respectful person and lends a listening ear to anyone even despite being busy.  In view of our department manager: She is an effective manager and someone who manages her team well. She understands each employee's uniqueness, and approaches individuals effectively . She is understanding to an extent that she is concerned about our personal situations.  WHY I FEEL THAT HILTON PROVIDES JOB SATISFACTION :  1. Hilton recognizes me and appreciates my individual traits and qualities   2. I'm happy by what I am doing because I know that we are making our customers happy   3. working under good management   4. opportunities to grow in the organization . For example my mangers were more than willing to support me when I wanted to do a cross training with a department which was one of my passions   5. Hilton is a well reputed brand with a strong and rich history","the wide range of people you meet hereboth staff and guests.

Please stop yelling. The only call I have with Joe Berger is not an interactive one, that´s why I wonder if in other calls where everyone talks he yells, or maybe if he keeps interrupting others while giving ideas or giving any explanation. Maybe is a cascade leadership style that other regional positions just follow. I think is very toxic to work on an environment that says one thing and does another. We all are always working for our team members, but who cares about General Managers? And is not only the yelling problem is the public demeaning treatment,  it seems that where there are more than one regional things tend to get uglier, it is like they want to show to others how strong and ¨bad¨ they are. I really do not think that my job is to educate the senior leadership of my región, but I do think they must learn, themselves, to distinguish between public and private venues for correcting underlings. We are not supposed to embarrass people, but to inspire them. Listening while others talk is a matter of basic education. The senior leaders of my region do not offer the support we really need, they actually represents more work to do and more difficult situations to deal with. It is always expected from me to accomplish deadlines and be on time to meetings, but it seems that they do not have the same requirement for themselves. Please stop being intimidating and start being  positive leaders of your area of support. Stop being bosses and begin being supportive leaders.","I like being part of a big company with a prestigious name, is just a glam flash for those who really does not have idea of how really is.

I have been with the organization for a fair period of time, and this is both through observation and personal experience.    The responsibility falls onto the team member to proactively structure their progression plans with their direct managers - this I whole-heatedly agree as we need to be personally driving our own growth and development, as well as the tempos of our careers. However, this assumes that all managers are extremely involved and ready to develop and help their team members succeed and move on. The reality is in a relatively flat hierarchy, it it can be threatening for some managers when their team is working towards a progression which would place them on an equivalent rank. What happens when leadership changes and the original career development plans are disrupted? I was once denied a promotion that was committed to me for over 12 months, because the new leader wanted to ""observe my performance"". How should one manage such curve-balls, which sets one's career back by a good year?    Could we do more to ensure fair, progressive opportunities are given to ALL, and not just to those who (a) have great managers or (b) team members who apply for new opportunities in the organization? Can HR or Commercial Services have a more holistic picture of career development plans for the overall team, especially for high-performing individuals? I have been told repeatedly that ""in order to get promoted you need to demonstrate an expanded scope of work"". However, I have seen instances where team members are promoted, and there is no obvious expansion in role. Can we ensure that the same yardstick applies across all team members?    Lastly, some functions are not as ""measurable"" as compared to others, in terms of ROI and deliverables.

Everybody is busy creating & analysing reports.

At the moment Sales & Marketing is more busy for analysing the same figures Revenue Teams analyse and do not have time to do their own job.  This unfortunately also impact on a week perception in these two disciplines. If we are really sure Honors and On-Line can compensate the relationships, we can completely cancel both Sales & Marketing departments. If not;  we need to focus on treating all three departments fairly   3. In high inflation countries, corporate funded team members receive lower salary increases compared to hotel teams based in the same country. Both parties are paid in the local currency and they are both subject to same law and regulations, therefore there needs to be alignment in increase percentages.

Of course, to increase the salary! Due to very low salary a lot of really good workers have to leave hotel and look for another job.

So as you see it's left 90 EUR per month for living (note! I have my own flat that means I don't need to rent it for (min.)190 EUR and more)). It's impossible to live on 90 EUR the whole month, as a girl I also want to buy not only groceries, but also clothes, manicure to look like at work appropriate, to go to the cinema or theatre, and I'm not talking about travelling.

Always when I have some problem and expecting him to help me as a manager he don't have enough knowledge what to do he always sending me to other managers. Very often he making offensive comments to girls or boys. Most of the time when we need his help on restaurant or other departments he is never there for us most of time going home in the most busy time he is never staying longer for support us when we need that. Most of time when we are needing him on the restaurant he is in back office pretending to doing some job. He don't have knowledge about simple things for example how to put order through the micros or how to make a reports or do a cash up I think its so shame for a manager to don't know that. He is even scared to take a lead on the shift when a supervisor calling sick. I am not feeling comfortable to work with him for example when am dealing with complains and make it right he always getting involved and going after us to customers and make as looks on their eyes like we don't know what we are doing. I think on the manager position should be someone who have enough experience and knowledge to be on this position not a person who don't know anything I think some of team members have better knowledge about work on f&b that he has. When he is going to home early he is never checking other departments if is everything alright sometimes he is just going without any one knows about that.,"One of our manager (Mohammed Hussein Jehangir), that's the person who really surprised me very often in this place in not a very good or positive way...

He is just not enough competent person and is not doing his job at all. He is trying to be helpful but sometimes just coming for a shift and being more problem for all of us. Ha just show with his finger what we should do what wasn't doe proper. Talking a lots but on on the right and needed subject for our business. Don't recognize a lot. I don't think that he respect people a lot. In my pinion all responsibilities which he is doing now probably lots of staff could do also ( moving furniture's, printing menus).

The majority of complaints about our hotel is regarding the facilities and the environment, which the staff then have to deal with which is a problem out of our control.  Hilton need to renovate many areas in our hotel to bring them up to modern standards which would reduce the number of guest complaints and improve the working experience.  For example, the TVs in the bedroom are still standard definition (and very poor quality) in 2017 - it's embarrassing.

Train Reception on GCE prices or general queries to help when people come in to enquire on the weekends but GCE work 9-5 Monday-Friday.   Train some reception team members who are more experienced in reservations, so that any queries can be dealt with on weekends for coming weeks ahead as reservations work Monday-Friday 9-5 too.

The Teamwork ethos shines through with a can do attitude being to the forefront,"When the HR function changed structure, the one team ethos was launched, which I believe is a good mantra. However as we have progressed forward I do not feel that this ethos has been maintained or supported. I feel there is a disconnect between the COEs and the field HR. Each COE has their targets and goals which have to be driven out to the hotels. There seems to be a lack of communication between the COEs so that HRMs have to support various initiatives at the same time and at short notice. Whilst we maybe aware that an initiative is planned, the finer details of what is required can be very last minute and time consuming as it requires buy-in from the relevant parties within the hotels. I feel that the value of the role of HRM is questioned by the COEs as there is not a full understanding of what the role entails.     On another note about the one team ethos, I also feel that the field team are treated differently when it comes to rewards and recognition. I know that there is cost implications when trying to reward and recognise all team members within such a large team, however I believe it is unfair when the COEs are continually recognised and rewarded for their work throughout the year by their HRBPs, when this has not happened within our field team.",11

However, the changes to the BAS program and overall scheduling have gone down. The hours are not available within 5 minutes of scheduling opening at 7am est on Thursday.  There is no flexibility and there are no consistent hours for us to schedule. In addition, since differential pay for weekends and evenings are no longer available, there are no incentives for employees to want to work these hours creating staffing shortages. In my opinion, employees should be able to build reasonable schedules until BAS is closed. If we are overstaffed, LCV should be offered. The BAS was excellent for years and one of the reasons I really liked working for Hilton. Please consider using core hours and providing extra pay incentives for weekends and evenings. Seems like we have ruined a good process...",I like the fact that I am able to build my own schedule each week. Hilton over all with the schedule flexibility is one of the best companies to work for. But it would be absolutely wonderful if Build-A-Schedule would be available away from home where we would be able to do it through our EmPower/WorkForce app. Because if we take more than a week off and are out of town say Tuesday through Wednesday we are not able to BAS for that week. I think we should be able to do this when we are away from home. This should be a little more flexible for Hilton W@H Employees.,"There are many things that I like about working for Hilton.  One of the main reasons is that I am able to work from my home and still have a life.  With the flexibility of me being able to build my own schedule is terrific.  I can build my schedule around other ""life"" events.  I also love being able to build my hours from 15 hours to 29 hours.  Sometimes there are weeks when I can only work 15 hours, but it is so great to know that if I need more hours, then I can schedule myself to work more the next week.",7634
PTO,Country, United States,134.979099998,4.00080904427e-203,829,4113,I am always worried that it won't work out that I won't be able to give away my shift and lose my job.  I wish our DC could make the decision if we could prove we had to leave short notice for a love one that we take care of.  They won't be here forever but it is important that I am able to leave when they need me.  The schedule times I work my BAS around that.  But both my parents have fell several times.  Just this summer my mother was rushed to the hospital and was there for 2 weeks in ICU with a blood infection.  Most of the time I was already scheduled with PTO time because we had a family vacation scheduled for Mexico that I was not able to go to even though I had already paid for so my family went without me.  I do not work enough hours right now to get family time but it would be nice if I could prove to my DC with airline ticket and hospital records that he could put a code in my schedule that it would not count against me.  I stress for the one week to give away my hours.,"I would prefer PTO to be available for us to take any day of the week. Sometimes because of scheduling or dates needed off and BAS hour requirements, it is necessary to PTO on a Sat or Sun.  I believe expecting us to work EVERY weekend during peek season, not being able to work minimum of 10 hours and make up the difference the remainder of the month, AND working 25 mandatory part time hours for 8 weeks is unreasonable.  Many workers have children that are on vacation and can only take time off during this time.  I believe where peek season is concerned, seniority should have some clout - no weekends, only have to build 20 hrs, etc.  What incentive is there for someone to work here for 5 or more years if they are going to be treated the same as a brand new employee??  I also believe peek season rules should be split between the employees like the holidays are split.  Group A works peek schedule 2017, Group B works peek schedule 2018 and so on and so forth.","PTO should not include sick time. It is difficult to plan time off and enjoy the benefit of Hilton Go if one gets something like the flu or needs to take care of loved ones in crisis. Taking time off to recover from illness or surgery should not devour vacation time where one can relax and enjoy family time.     Also, for those that are salary, they should be able to take time off as needed and not 8 hours at a time. Time is accrued in hours, one should be able to take it in hours as needed.",4942

Since they have came out with those to me they are always wrong. If a guest select the wrong number in the VOC it can mess up your whole percentage. I just do not think that your whole award should be based on the VOC & FCR scores. Sometimes people choose not to do the VOC & FCR and if they do then your percentage is low so you are not eligible for CTE. The award program need to be revisited and I think the supervisor should have more say so in that award. The scores are not accurate nor trustworthy. It is always something wrong with them and then they came out in the middle of the 2nd quarter and those numbers where still used to base if you get CTE or not. The award program is definitely something that needs work on because I work hard the whole quarter thinking I am going to make it and don't. It is really discouraging more than encouraging.,"VOC is a new metric we must now meet. All guests have always heard the prompt that their call is being recorded for quality assurance and to stay on the line  for a 2 question survey. They have always had the opportunity to express their feedback so nothing has changed for the guest.  As resv agents  we must now get a yes (1) for first question and a ""5"" for our second question.  Anything else, even a 4 is considered a failure. We also have a minimum percentage to meet. Some people  with never give a perfect score as they feel there is always room for improvement!  Also, most happy customers don't take time from their busy lives to take a survey.  This is something we cant force them to do this even though these surveys will now determine if we receive incentive money and pay raises . There is a minimum requirement of surveys to meet. This is especially difficult for those reservation agents who are leading in HGV/EHI transfers.    I understand VOC is important feedback for HILTON but it feels like another metric to worry about that we don't have a lot of control over.","The new VOC added to our monthly stats is simply unfair!

When I have a guest that just wants to take one night off a three day stay or wants to add a night and doesn't mind changing rooms, but I can't and for no real good reason.  That leaves my guest questioning.  And me as well.  I don't understand all the in's and out's of how revenue is made and MLOS,, but I do understand when my guest is frustrated because we both know there is a room to be had and he can't have it.  I know this is a hotel thing and not so much  ""Hilton"" thing, but maybe you can help us out by giving us a better answer than ""Sorry, it's so we don't inconvenience the guest.""

We often receive performance notifications by emails each month and we often get points and smiles all through the year, telling us how well we are performing, but when we get our annual assessments, we barely get a quarter as a raise. The pay as a full time hire doesn't meet the needs with the cost of living we have to endure. It is very low and yet more tasks are constantly being added to our job descriptions. As far as the health benefits, It is too costly considering the pay we receive and the fact that we can barely utilize it because we can't afford co-pays or the balances left after going to be seen at the Dr. Some families depend on just the income from Hilton full time employees. Hard to take care of a family not having competitive pay. We have to provide money for our own phones lines to do the job, and are not compensated for that...we also have to accept whatever hours available to work each week, which are slim and we do not receive shift differential for having to be stuck with only late hours. The system (BAS) states that we can work up to 12 hours each day, but there aren't even enough hours posted avail to take a 12 hour shift if that is what you choose to do. This is not building your schedule. To build your schedule, there should be options avail for you to select other than the same hours each day. These details make it very stressful and difficult to enjoy your job even when you want to. There are many elements that are great, but in these areas, I think Hilton would not have as many turn overs if employees could feel more job security and feel that they can take care of their families by working here.","While I love Hilton and it's amazing benefits, I would like to suggest having more option to those that are Building their Schedule. I was hired and told I would be able to build within my Core hours at all times. That has never been an issue until recently. I am now in Guest Assistance after moving from other departments. I was not told that Core Hours may not be available to me when I build my schedule. I noticed several days did not have any Core hours available to me in GA when I went to build. I couldn't build at all 3 days out of a week. I was only given an option to build on certain days and times, which made it seem more to me like a Set schedule. I also would like to have more Flexibility in GA being a BAS agent, as I always had in other departments. It would be nice to have more BAS options for Full time agents. If there were more opportunity to become a Full time GA agent with a BAS, then that would help out a lot of agents. GA seems to be busier than other desks, so maybe if more people were given an opportunity to become full time and build their schedule, then they would be properly staffed and if its too busy, lcv could always be offered for them and then would be able to take off work and Hilton wouldn't have to pay them. Just my thoughts. Also, it would be nice to have some hours outside of Core open up for agents weekly. Lastly, it would be nice to be able to switch departments even if you have not been on that particular desk for at least 3 months. Sometimes, an opportunity for a position you really wanted doesn't come available for a long time again, and if you have only been on a particular desk for less than 3 months, you cannot apply for it, so you miss out on an opportunity you have been wanting more than others. It would be nice to have no minimum call requirements for prizes for work giveaways by DC or Managers.

I know we are compared to other reservationists during the same time period, but I often feel like I have no control over the guests that I get on the phone and often get a lot of group, corporate, or government reservations and it affects my pay.  I understand the idea is to motivate us to upsell, but sometimes I find it demoralizing when I can measure up due to no fault of my own.  I know I've seen a lot of complaints about using VOC as a measurement, but I think it gives the company a sense of whether or not we are pleasing our guests.  I would rather make a guest happy with the service I provide getting them the right fit.  I think there is a lot of pressure to sell and upsell.  For a job with a lower pay scale even with incentives, I think there is too much pressure.  Also I get that we are to use the approach that the company thinks is best to sell, but sometimes you have to feel a customer out and not used a canned line.  You hired us because we had the personality to do the job, sometimes it feels like we are too restricted.

Maybe the dollars budgeted is a factor for Hilton but its my opinion needs serious work. Systems too cumbersome, slow and too many logins for applications at hand. Bottom line, costs too many production hours that could enhance bookings and customer service and system performance metrics/ratios when measured across a 1,000 or so agents. Just sayin. Not being critical though, I still get my job done.","1.  The I-Earn return to the old system.  The average for the month.

The days that seem to be the most stressful, are caused by problems that can mostly be avoided (or more-so than they are). I have found that there seems to be a communication issue here, between departments, and other coworkers. There have been too many times, for example, that we will call about the status of a room we are needing to be cleaned, and housekeeping will answer and say they are checking it, but then they never tell us when/if it's ready, and we have to just keep checking over the next hour or two to see if the status will ever be changed, or call them back a few times to check. I also feel like we need to utilize our email system more than we do, in our department anyways. There's been multiple times that we could have avoided confrontation with a guest later, if we were told about their situation earlier (or if things were left for a certain guest, but we are never told where they are left.) A simple email could fix lots of these issues. If we could make sure we are all on the same page about situations going on in the hotel (not issuing late checkouts on a sold out night/week so we can have rooms available for arrivals next day, inputting statuses of rooms into hskping system, and making sure we leave notes on reservations about special circumstances...) we could improve or avoid many problems.","Issues with tools and equipment in our department:  1)Radios we used in the HOUSEKEEPING DEPARTMENT  are not enough for users, most of them are always low batteries and defective, and yet the management will tell you to come very early so you can get the radio you need.  2)Device ,also always low batteries and not enough for users., also we received guest calls late. example, we just receive the call and it indicated on the device that it is 30-40 minutes passed already that causes delays.  3) management/supervisors tends to overload us with workloads giving us too much stress and pressures. guest calls, dirty linen collections and trash, cleaning the rooms, vacuuming the hallways , cleaning the stairs on top of helping attendants in stripping rooms on busy checked out days.

I would LOVE to see some type of relief program put in place so that people and families affected by these storms would receive a break instead of the contrary.

Since I work in Luxury and am trained for EVERY desk pretty much our desk is very limited to overtime and I can't see the overtime that was available and badly needed on the General/Hotel desk meaning I had to manually apply for overtime and wait almost 8 hours to see if it was approved when my desk I can submit and see the hours available for instant approval. Also during the hurricane the pet policy for most hotels was not waived and that should be waived at any hotel under the circumstances. People were on the highways for hours looking for shelter and we had to send them away to other states because the hotels were not waiving the pet policy and fees for emergency. The information we received was not uniform that we can check one specific focal point for information we were having to scan 6-10 hot topics to find if the hotels were open, closed, damaged, had no power etc....this should be in RED on the main Infoweb screen and updated constantly so we didn't have to read 6 pages of info and then still call the hotel to verify if they were open, had generators, had evacuated, etc....all and all considering we did great but I think more could be organized considering all the issues with fires, earthquakes, etc that we have a uniform policy to cover for all properties.","My department leader is sometimes impossible to speak with reasonably. He constantly insults us and accuses us of poor integrity, during talks of compromise to create work schedules that don't have us burning out for seven straight days. After the offer to request off for Tropical Storm Nate (when forecasts predicted a Category 1-2 Hurricane), he accused our  us of having terrible work ethic, contentious attitudes, and poor character for opting shelter at home. He even went as far to accuse us for our Hurricane call-off as a public display of insubordination, and attempted to reprimand us. This insulting culture of unnecessary conflict, vindictiveness, hostility, and pettiness trickles all the way down from Rudy's leadership (sans Heather and Anne, who are incredible). I would suggest creating a work culture where we can approach our managers to find COMPROMISE, and without fear of insults or retribution within disagreement.",165
remodel,Country, United States,21.5421189897,2.66970973099e-17,81,1448,"We are in such a need of a remodel, our air in the Grand Foyer sounds like a jetplane, when it doesn't sound like a jetplane it sounds like a bowling alley, it really is ridiculous.  Our bathroom on this level is hurting as well, needs a huge revamp (plus there is no changing table, which should be in men's and women's), the carpet you can only clean so many times and whoever picks the next...please think about wine and dark colors spilling ALL THE TIME.  We always have unsightly stains that we can't get out.  Our reader boards are outdated, would be cool to have interactive signs, or a program that is simpler to use (adding logo or custom slides).  We are ALWAYS short on dishes for large banquet events, our linen looks old and haggard if we even have enough or enough clean because Laundry always has something broken delaying us to get clean ironed linens, we run short on silverware, and our stage is mismatched and awful, doesn't even line up correctly.  We are down to NO lobby furniture and it would be SO NICE to see furniture and connectivity stations in the remodel.  It just seems like it keeps getting pushed forward and we REALLY need some of these things now.  Oh and also the AIRWALLS, reupholstering will not fix the sound issues, nor fix the gaps and pieces missing.","Work Atmosphere/Environment.  Suggested improvements:  I would suggest that every work area be treated the same when remodeling.  Some of the work areas/departments in our company are very, very beautiful and tastefully designed (new furnishings, great colors, new carpeting, etc.).  Some other work areas are very poor in design (no colors, worn carpet, old furnishings, -- no thought out design at all).  It's as if you're walking into several companies, instead of one company as a whole.  Since we're all Hilton, why not update all areas/department with a fresh and updated look.  It's doesn't have to be super expensive.  Having an updated space to work in makes the company an even greater place to work.  Also, the bathrooms are very dated and could be upgraded.","Have security and/or guard at entrance 24/7... it will eliminate a lot of problems such as: homeless coming in the hotel urinating in bathrooms or stairs, clientele who don't have guest suites but use facilities such as pool and comp services such as breakfast, evening reception. Even if they get a guest suite they invite the whole neighborhood and have more than 6 people in guest suite (8, 10, 20) creating an excessive work for housekeeping (cleaning rooms), breakfast (long lines), evening reception (long lines) and destroying the rooms ... leaving stains in carpet, etc ... not only that but in addition steeling pillows, blankets, towels from pool/guest suites, etc. If they use F&B outlets, they don't tip or find a way to complaint so they can get a free meal.  It also creates a  parking problem because there are a lot of non-registered cars. In addition they constantly break the gate pole, so there is free entrance to everyone.   There has been many fights and calls to the police because the trouble that this type of clientele creates.  The hotel is going through renovation and is investing a lot of money in new look. PLEASE CONSIDER TO INVEST IN A SECURITY GUARD at entrance, so this type of clientele won't destroy the new renovated hotel or chase away the guests that are paying for their accommodations.  There is no security at all at this hotel... would hate for something bad to happen so management will finally react and have security up front/entrance to control entrance and exit.",1529
garage,Country, United States,21.2694339392,9.68715906533e-12,53,900,"We need better parking arrangements. Its a safety hazard to have cars parking in the 'drive' area of the parking garage. The lights are constantly going out and they should be fully replaced, not just the bulbs. Our Employee garage needs to have security cameras, in the stair wells and the main exits for those of us working night shifts or even during the day. I recommend looking into how FAU runs their parking. They can issue tickets, $10-$25, which I think is reasonably fair for someone who cannot follow the rules as other employees would. We need double decals, employees have the one in the front of their car, but we need one in the back. This way our security officers may know who is supposed to be in the garage for that day. On days of self parking and we do not have to park at Bible Town, we need a 24 hour notice that there would be self parking. Every shift  I arrive with 30- 45 min to spare before work just to make sure I have parking, since I never know when a group will be self parking. If we receive notice to park off property the same should be applied when we share our garage with groups. I also believe we need a parking meter, while Guests and members use the parking garage when permitted, there are multiple occasions when someone should not be parking in the garage and  does taking away parking for us employees. Or Per-haps there should be an area for metered parking, to help cut down on random parking. I would also suggest work  ID's. There are so many guests, or convention guests, who I have seen sneak into the employee cafeteria, we should be like a working like a high school. You are issued a work ID, and you fill this ID with money  and you swipe this card instead of your credit card. This would also cut back on random visitors walking around property, you must show you ID badge at Security- which needs to crack down on this- or be issued one for the day. I believe these suggests would greatly help run our resort, behind the scenes.","Too many emails, information overload from hotel staff and Hilton emails (Hilton 360, HHive, Now, etc).  If emails were responded to, without having to ask again and again, then that would also reduce email flow.  Employee Entrance - have all non-line staff be able to enter/exit from other doors. Current system is not effective since staff also utilize the garage.    Clean back of house hallways, stairwells, garage, walkways, elevators, landings, walls.  Do not allow cell phone use while working-constantly see uniformed staff on phones, even in guest hallways (games, FB)  Exec Committee needs to be more engaged, involved, responsive (less arrogant) and execute changes and make improvements, not just talk about them or worse, ignore them.    Hotel Manager needs to improve his engagement, responsiveness and follow up - it is a key role and he needs to be effective and active, saying and doing are two very different things.  Accountability - Managers and staff need to be accountable for their actions or Lack of.    Sales incentive plan:  Very difficult to reach goals at each hotel.","REWARDS FOR THOSE WITH PERFECT ATTENDANCE      MORE SECURITY IN PARKING GARAGE, IT CAN BE DANGEROUS.

We are not compensated enough, especially people who have worked for Hilton for several years. Our hourly rate is too low. To have your paycheck raise by cents each year even as a great worker is frustrating.  It's impossible to keep up with inflation. Even when we have good conversion and can make a bit extra for that, we are making mere cents for booking rooms. You can see the money that you have booked....generating  thousands of dollars for Hilton, but our paycheck will show mere cents or a few dollars for all that income. :(","After working here for many years, I feel like should be making several more dollars per hour than I do.  I do feel that compensation based on performance is fair, but maybe the calculations being used she be looked at.  Considering the starting pay was not great, and even if you had exemplary performance every month, the most you can get on a yearly raise is 4%......do you think with rising costs for food, electricity, housing, medical expenses, etc, that 35-50 cent a year raise keeps up with cost of living?      There comes a point, no matter how great the company/flexibility of schedules/tmtp is, if you are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to meet expenses, it will not be enough.  If you can't afford to travel at ALL, what good is a tmtp?  My medical coverage plan is not as good and the price went up.....so now I have to decide, do I use grocery money to cover co-payments?  Which medications do I need to skip because I can't afford all of them?    This year agents are given a little more autonomy in there jobs which is a good thing, but it is still expecting more from the employees, without additional compensation.  So if the company can reduce there help desk staff, get rid of the redemption specialists (who get paid more money) and RSS employees are picking up the slack, we should be compensated.  Anyone with a brain can see how the changes being made this year benefit the company financially!  We need help with the hourly wages, period.","I believe the pay scale is very low.  When a member is great at sales and her conversions and adr are way above 120%  and the iearn you get when you sold over 4million and the payout to the teammember isn't even 1% that is not good at all.  We give great service and the employees who make the company a lot of money should be looked at compared to the ones who are working to have a job and a paycheck.  The min wage is poor and I believe the bonus checks should be on separate checks to also let the employee feel like they are really being rewarded then to be taxed so big you don't even see the bonus.

It is difficult to be productive after flying 6+ hours in coach.  There should be additional allowances for long-distance/international travel.  A recommendation would be to negotiate a program with our preferred airline partners for corporate travel.  I have worked for large companies that had additional benefits for employees that included 4 complimentary upgrades per year and lounge access. This would allow non-VP level Team Members to upgrade their travel at no additional cost to the company for at least some of those longer/international flights.","Please consider allowing all employees to fly business class for long-haul flights (e.g., flights to Asia from the US). The current policy only allows VP level and above to fly business class, and 24-hour one-way trips can be difficult - flying in economy makes it difficult to be get work done, and the recovery time at the destination after a 24-hour flight is much longer, which impacts productivity.","I think it is great that the Singapore office supports ALL team members to fly business class for long haul flights. However, it is important for the leader of my corporate function to support that as well by allowing team members of all ranks to fly business class to US/UK destinations, and not just limiting this benefit to directors and above, as is still practiced. Flying from Singapore to the US can take up to 20 hours, and the purpose of allowing team members to take a higher class of flight is to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis, which affected a team member before. Limiting long-haul flights to economy for those who aren't directors exposes these team members to the risk of deep vein thrombosis and is not a great way for team members to Thrive.",144

We often receive performance notifications by emails each month and we often get points and smiles all through the year, telling us how well we are performing, but when we get our annual assessments, we barely get a quarter as a raise. The pay as a full time hire doesn't meet the needs with the cost of living we have to endure. It is very low and yet more tasks are constantly being added to our job descriptions. As far as the health benefits, It is too costly considering the pay we receive and the fact that we can barely utilize it because we can't afford co-pays or the balances left after going to be seen at the Dr. Some families depend on just the income from Hilton full time employees. Hard to take care of a family not having competitive pay. We have to provide money for our own phones lines to do the job, and are not compensated for that...we also have to accept whatever hours available to work each week, which are slim and we do not receive shift differential for having to be stuck with only late hours. The system (BAS) states that we can work up to 12 hours each day, but there aren't even enough hours posted avail to take a 12 hour shift if that is what you choose to do. This is not building your schedule. To build your schedule, there should be options avail for you to select other than the same hours each day. These details make it very stressful and difficult to enjoy your job even when you want to. There are many elements that are great, but in these areas, I think Hilton would not have as many turn overs if employees could feel more job security and feel that they can take care of their families by working here.",I like the fact that I am able to build my own schedule each week.

HRCC,Generation, Generation X,2.35871552121,1.36468341997e-05,103,144,"HRCC is run like a Circus.  I suggest realizing it is 2017- people do not want their hands held- they do not want to tell their life story. They want to make their reservation, get a clean room at a fair price and be on their way. The news Res 2.0 and 'Wheel' is a waste of time, I suggest benching this and empowering us to have organic conversations with our guests. We are becoming scripted robots.  I suggest investing money in the software we use.  It is maddening, day after day, having at least one of my tools not working.  If upper executive management is aware of how HRCC is operating, it is obvious they do not care about team member satisfaction.  If they are not aware, I suggest they take some time to look around. Agents are constantly having to worry about our ""numbers,"" yet we have arbitrary moving targets to reach.  Each day is something new, and the only focus is on finding ways the punish us, not empower and enrich us. I have been with HRCC for many years, and the changes I have seen are not at all for the better. Morale is at an all time low among team members- we are in fear of our jobs being outsourced, and many are quite unhappy. I stay for GO Hilton, and build a schedule.  Even the guests are feeling it. I spend my days fixing reservations made by overseas agents, or assisting third party booking site agents do their jobs.  I suggest we STOP using third party sites.  Southwest Airlines is the #2 profiting airline in the US. They consistently receive awards for outstanding customer service- here is one place to purchase tickets for Southwest- directly from Southwest. They are not on Expedia, or  booking.com. I suggest you look long and hard at how HRCC is run, and make immediate changes to agent expectations and treatment. At this point, I am trying to finish my ten year ""sentence"" to get my lifelong FTP benefits. It's really quite sad. I used to LOVE my job, now I dread ""auto in"" each day.  Shame on you, Conrad did NOT envision this. PAY ATTENTION!!","It is a shame that Hilton decided to use an outside company like FPG and pay them who knows how much money. We are blessed to have very talented agents, DCs and managers who are experts in what WE DO. FPG isn't. FPG has basically integrated into our protocol, a protocol that you hear on the phones if you call anyone in a business atmosphere these days. Everyone is using the transition to discovery, etc. WE NEED TO STAND OUT as an industry leader, not be just like everyone else. Our own talented, experienced employees that are top performers should have before and should now take what FPG created and adjust it to the Hilton way...a way that would make us shine above everyone else. Agents should be trusted to lead the call in the direction the guest needs, not insist on being travel agents to guests who have already done their research, already know what they want, are in a hurry or are business travelers needing a corporate rate. We are not trusted as employees and it hurts morale. Last week when I asked what brings you to the area, the guest responded, next question. As agents, we need to have some flexibility to handle our calls, not try to trick business travelers into an upgrade when we know they need to travel at their company per diem. This job used to be fun. We could occasionally have a call where we really connected with someone. Now we have so much to remember, that even though I am no longer just an order taker as I was originally taught, I feel even more robotic than ever trying to fit in everything FPG drummed up for us to say. I'm not suggesting we throw the baby out with the bath water, but I am suggesting that we take this plan and morph it into something original. We want to stand out in the industry? Res 2.0 is not the way to go. And just out of curiosity, overseas locations are producing more calls than we are. Are they using Res 2.0? Should we be concerned about job security? This is a morale issue. Thank you for taking the time to read my words.",There is a difference in being proud of Hilton as a corporation and all that it offers versus being apart of the HRCC organizational structure.  This survey is great as an assessment of Hilton but there needs to be specifications for the divisions of Hilton that employees work among.

We need to get our core AM hours back.  I have no work life balance. I worked 6 years of nights to get a morning core BAS starting at  830 am just for it to be taken away 6 months later.

Our worlds are now turned upside down and so are our families.  Many of us working over nights into days with just a few hours off here and there. Trying to sleep when we can and balance children, other commitments etc... it is not healthy. I feel Hilton stopped caring about our health and balance.  When we complain we are scolded as if we are children. When Hilton hires they need to hire staff just for nights bring back shift differential etc bonus to work over nights. Put cores back on our AM shifts with BAS and  help us balance our lives again.","I suggest going back to Core Hours.  You inexplicably removed core hours from the whole organization.  I have been here for almost 8 years, 5 of those years working mid, to late afternoons.  I have  earned the right to move to AM core and that's what happened to me a year ago.  However, for some odd reason scheduling /forecasting decided that it would be better to not have core hours and let people choose from a 24 hour scale.  About a month later, I keep getting emails (demanding, threatening) that we are not choosing the correct hours when we BAS and complaining we are SHORT staffed in the evening.  Ok, I know what caused that, do you?  That's what happens when you take people on a designated night core and allow them to BAS anytime.  There are people working early mornings that JUST got out of training.  Where is their tenure working afternoon/evening?? That's completely unfair that brand new people are able to work morning hours.  BAS has been horrible with avail hours.  I have to work one week over night hours and the following week afternoon hours and if im lucky, I can get a few morning hours.  I can't make a life outside of work, if I have NO idea when I could get hours.   It's a nightmare I feel like you have brought on yourself as an organization as well as your employees.  The amount of stress that myself and other agents go through because of this one single decision is astounding.  Since it was your doing, you should be held responsible for the ensuing mess, not the us who are struggling to get hours. 2nd thing I need to mention is the RESMART program that was rolled out to agents extremely premature.  I am confused as why a large, professional company would roll out a program that wasn't finished. It's a disgrace to read and use.  Time consuming, inaccurate and loss of sales. It's been almost 3 months and still remains awful to use and affecting my performance.  I tried to ""improve resmart"" but it wasn't implemented & ignored after I did their jobs.","More flexibility in hours!!!!!!! We used to be able to build hours outside our ""Core"" but now sometimes I cant even build my schedule in my core because there are no hours available unless you log right in at 7am on Thursday morning..... which I can not do because I am a parent who has to take my son to the bus stop at that time. For example, this week I could only build 16 of my required 20 hours because there were only 30 minute segments available on the other days. Who wants (OR CAN) work 30 minutes at a time here and there throughout the day????!!!!!!! The Build-a-Schedule program you have is a joke. Then, throughout the week we are on RED ALERT because no enough people are working. OPEN UP MORE HOURS so we can schedule ourselves. Offer an incentive to people who work high demand hours.

Of course we need to adopt local/regional culture and their realistic situation, however the balance between keeping Hilton global standard and adjustment locally is of paramount importance. Regional team should be more supportive to deliver the global standard rather than sacrificing and compromising from the first instance.

organization,Generation, Generation X,1.46101614343,2.16573262753e-05,534,1593,"I would like to see our most senior leadership do more to engage with middle/front-line managers.  Currently, the culture is top up management meaning that it seems that the team that reports to our SVP is more concerned with making waves than offering any suggestions or feedback that may not be well-received.  The culture initiatives seem very selective and there seems to be a negative stigma attached to tenured employees as not being as valuable to the organization as college new hires or people who come into the organization with a polished pedigree.  I used to be proud of telling people how long I worked for Hilton and how much I have grown because of all of the opportunities I have been provided because of outstanding performance.  Today, I prefer to come in, get my work done to the best of my ability and go home.","I think the main area of work for the organization lies in two areas, effective communication from the top and career path assistance.      Priorities and communications do not flow throughout the organization the way we would expect them too, specific focus should be made to improve messaging.  The volume and number of communication vehicles are overwhelming.  The lobby, email, HU, Buzz, Group boards etc etc.  Increased leverage of video messaging could assist in delivering more content faster.    Career assistance is needed, for individuals to help our more junior personnel figure out what path they want to take, understand the organizational processes required to make them happen, and give them the tools to help make it happen themselves.  HR and Career processes are opaque and often dependent on who you know not performance or otherwise determined.  More organizational agility to move talent between functions will lead to increased innovation and collaboration.  Lastly, specific focus has to be put on not trying to make female employees function / work like their male peers in order to get ahead / enter leadership ranks.  Even female executives have been known to use negative comparisons to male peers (tone of voice, emotional etc) as excuses for not giving females the opportunities.  While generally as a women Hilton is a great place to work, with great flexibility and benefits.  Career opportunities are harder to come by than for our male counterparts.","Each group has many priorities. In this matrixed organization, it sometimes feels like we are competing for resources to address different groups priorities: data/analytics, media support, CRM, Honors, as examples. How can we do a better job, beyond big rocks templates, of aligning and leaving room to help each other on priorities? Perhaps, this long list of priorities from every team contributes to a general sense I get here that people are feeling quite maxed out, some maybe burned out.     Consistency - feels like company changes strategy often that results in many hotel-level initiatives and multiple consumer messages. Alignment on a strategy for enterprise/brand/purpose/hotel messaging and commitment to a 3-5 year  (vs annual) plan might help us make more progress on fewer, high impact initiatives with more manageable workload.",2127

Right now, it's wishy-washy. And that breeds uncertainty...which is never good for business.","I think it is great that the Singapore office supports ALL team members to fly business class for long haul flights. However, it is important for the leader of my corporate function to support that as well by allowing team members of all ranks to fly business class to US/UK destinations, and not just limiting this benefit to directors and above, as is still practiced. Flying from Singapore to the US can take up to 20 hours, and the purpose of allowing team members to take a higher class of flight is to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis, which affected a team member before. Limiting long-haul flights to economy for those who aren't directors exposes these team members to the risk of deep vein thrombosis and is not a great way for team members to Thrive.","It is still true that in many instances the technical support we receive is not consistent with the HILTON values.  There need to be more effective remediation methods when we need to raise system issues on behalf of a property.  Even if we have a clear understanding of the issue a property user is having, and we can document and articulate it, we are unable to open a ticket and the onus falls on the property to pursue it.  Often times this results in the ticket being closed because the situation is not fully understood by the property contact.

I think at a corporate level we are doing a lot already but it is important particularly at hotel level as well that new innovative approaches are adopted and become the new norm, like job sharing at executive level, for all Heads of departments to sometimes be able to work from home. Have team members be able to give much more input on the work hours instead of just being assigned work hours.","There are many things that I like about working for Hilton.  One of the main reasons is that I am able to work from my home and still have a life.  With the flexibility of me being able to build my own schedule is terrific.  I can build my schedule around other ""life"" events.  I also love being able to build my hours from 15 hours to 29 hours.  Sometimes there are weeks when I can only work 15 hours, but it is so great to know that if I need more hours, then I can schedule myself to work more the next week.","I love having the flexibility to be able to take my kids to school, pick them up, be home during the day and work at night.

At the end of the day the properties may still have many challenges and issues even though we have tried so much to improve them, there are just limitations on consultants, contractors and Owners capabilities on certain projects and in certain regions. But importantly I believe this is very well understood by my management, as they are also engineers who have had a similar role and so can therefore understand the challenges I face, which is good to know.

year,Generation, Generation X,1.19439629809,1.14999363599e-05,3034,1624,"I believe that the pay should be increased. We often receive performance notifications by emails each month and we often get points and smiles all through the year, telling us how well we are performing, but when we get our annual assessments, we barely get a quarter as a raise. The pay as a full time hire doesn't meet the needs with the cost of living we have to endure. It is very low and yet more tasks are constantly being added to our job descriptions. As far as the health benefits, It is too costly considering the pay we receive and the fact that we can barely utilize it because we can't afford co-pays or the balances left after going to be seen at the Dr. Some families depend on just the income from Hilton full time employees. Hard to take care of a family not having competitive pay. We have to provide money for our own phones lines to do the job, and are not compensated for that...we also have to accept whatever hours available to work each week, which are slim and we do not receive shift differential for having to be stuck with only late hours. The system (BAS) states that we can work up to 12 hours each day, but there aren't even enough hours posted avail to take a 12 hour shift if that is what you choose to do. This is not building your schedule. To build your schedule, there should be options avail for you to select other than the same hours each day. These details make it very stressful and difficult to enjoy your job even when you want to. There are many elements that are great, but in these areas, I think Hilton would not have as many turn overs if employees could feel more job security and feel that they can take care of their families by working here.",While we have made tremendous strides to improve our overall benefits over the years our healthcare benefits are still incredibly expensive.  I downgraded my plan this year and still increased the amount I pay each month.  My 3% annual raise doesn't go to me...it goes to health insurance and has been for the past few years.,I think that instead of yearly reviews it should be either quarterly or every 6 months.

In my opinion, choosing a particular route within the RMCC for a career path no longer provides the opportunity to move to a remote position in the future.  As we grow in the RMCC, I would really like to see that leadership is conscious of the balance between tenured team members vs. advancement opportunities to avoid turnover.  I would also suggest that leadership be more mindful of how they approach team member's career aspirations in order to not dissuade them from their goals simply because peers have been working on the same advancement opportunities for a longer time period.  Everyone should be weighed by their contributions and performance rather than how long they have been in their current role prior to moving into an advancement role.",I like the office culture at RMCC APAC.

accomodation,Generation, Millennials,4.70847990861,5.86618154253e-08,60,699,"A few suggestions:  1. I've done some research talking to some colleagues in the industy and have found that comparable jobs at comparable hospitality companies that are based in Chicago and Atlanta are making about the same as I am here. The major difference is that the cost of living in Northern VA and DC is about 34% more expensive then Atlanta. I think HR needs to look at this and take this into consideration more and should adjust compensation appropriately because I don't think this is fair and I think it will catch up to Hilton in the long run.  2. Hilton needs to make better accomodations for team members living in DC and NoVA. A few ideas I have are starting a shuttle service, like Google does in San Francisco. I have a friend who takes it every morning there and loves it because you meet more Hilton team members and can work on the shuttle too, saving time and actually allowing you to get more done. Also, having a satellite office in DC would be a really great accomodation. Again, I think it woudl allow people to network more across teams as well as just allowing further flexibility for all team members. This will become more and more important to potential employees every year and, personally, a reason I would debate leaing Hilton is because of it's location and lack of accomodations. Sometimes any job in DC seems like it could be the best job in thew world, just because it is in DC.

I have been with the organization for a fair period of time, and this is both through observation and personal experience.    The responsibility falls onto the team member to proactively structure their progression plans with their direct managers - this I whole-heatedly agree as we need to be personally driving our own growth and development, as well as the tempos of our careers. However, this assumes that all managers are extremely involved and ready to develop and help their team members succeed and move on. The reality is in a relatively flat hierarchy, it it can be threatening for some managers when their team is working towards a progression which would place them on an equivalent rank. What happens when leadership changes and the original career development plans are disrupted? I was once denied a promotion that was committed to me for over 12 months, because the new leader wanted to ""observe my performance"". How should one manage such curve-balls, which sets one's career back by a good year?    Could we do more to ensure fair, progressive opportunities are given to ALL, and not just to those who (a) have great managers or (b) team members who apply for new opportunities in the organization? Can HR or Commercial Services have a more holistic picture of career development plans for the overall team, especially for high-performing individuals? I have been told repeatedly that ""in order to get promoted you need to demonstrate an expanded scope of work"". However, I have seen instances where team members are promoted, and there is no obvious expansion in role. Can we ensure that the same yardstick applies across all team members?    Lastly, some functions are not as ""measurable"" as compared to others, in terms of ROI and deliverables.

career growth,Generation, Millennials,2.21663329956,1.17972835376e-11,300,7332,"The opportunity to grow your career and travel the world. Although it still depends a lot on who you know and some ""political"" aspects, which is the case in most companies, although it is an improvement point. But the overall growth and career development opportunities in comparison to other companies are definitely the best part of Hilton.","I think Hilton has great training and development opportunities as I personally experienced this with Hilton's Management Development Program. It is getting more difficult to obtain or start with a reasonable career path post graduation and Hilton provides a great opportunity for students. They also have programs in place while students are in college to get them in motion to prepare for a program of this nature. I know the Hilton makes strides to help those receive an GED by providing assistance or partner with companies enhance skills that may or may not relate directly to your job. They encourage education and career growth. I know managers tend to have a mentor which can be extremely beneficial for both the mentor and mentee. I love seeing the resources available to team members, however, there are many that do not know they exist so there could be improvement on communicating these platforms to team members.",I hope our company can provide more training and development opportunities which could be help us on career development.,7632
transportation,Generation, Millennials,2.21516025776,3.22171293122e-05,110,411,"I strongly believe the following should be implemented as benefits for team members:    - Improved commuter program, which includes a stipend to be utilized towards transportation costs to/from work. The metro is incredibly expensive and can cost DC residents upwards of $10/day to ride; OR a shuttle that transports DC residents to/from inner city DC and the McLean office building. This would be cost-effective for Hilton to do and help DC residents to save money as well as efficiently work during our commute to/from work. A prime example of this is Google, which offers employees a shuttle to transport them from the office and into San Francisco. This has incentivized people to be able to live anywhere and still work effectively from the Google office in Silicon Valley, as well as helped employees meet each other through the shuttle commute. Additionally, we would all love to see a shuttle vehicle that can operate in the morning and evenings to provide transportation to/from McLean office and Tysons Corner metro station  - Potential partnership with WeWork  - Improved health/fitness program, which includes a stipend to be utilized towards health or fitness costs incurred throughout the month. This would align with the goals of the Thrive program and would provide a greater incentive to become physically active and healthier. I know that Thrive is meant to be inclusive of all team members; however, at some point there needs to be a separation and there could be benefits of equal value provided to other team members.  - Major changes to the internal promotion and compensation structure. With Hilton's current internal promotion structure, the company encourages team members to leave the company and then come back in order to receive the promotion and the compensation desired at a faster pace. Compensation is currently capped at certain percentages and values, which hinders one's ability to be promoted and receive a salary fairly","I believe that Hilton has a terrible commuter benefit considering the poor accessibility to the Mclean office using public transportation. The Hilton Mclean office is located 0.7 miles away from the Tysons Corner Metro Station. However this 0.7 miles represent an additional 15-20 minutes of commuting time either by bus or by foot. The current bus available (424) that takes you to the office is very unreliable since it is available every 10-15 minutes. If you miss the bus in the morning for a couple of minutes or if its late, it can add a significant amount of time to your commute, which is already long if you commute from DC. Additionally, there are no close crosswalks from the office to the bus stop to take the bus back to the metro station in the afternoon. Currently, team members jaywalk a 6-lane highway to be able to get to the bus stop, which is extremely dangerous. Also, the high temperatures during the summer or very cold and windy winter season make it very difficult and unpleasant for team members to walk from or to the McLean office from the metro. Nowadays, millennial employees, especially analyst or entry level employees,  do not want to purchase a car and prefer to use shared economy services so Hilton needs to be aware that the Mclean office location is not easily accessible if you don't own a car and should find ways to improve it.   Hilton should offer a shuttle bus to pick and drop of from the Tysons Corner metro station like several other offices within the area (e.g. Fannie Mae) considering how unfriendly Tysons Corner is for pedestrians. This shuttle service is already available for team members in the Watford office in the morning, lunch and afternoon so Hilton should consider replicating this service in McLean.","It would be extremely beneficial to have a Hilton shuttle to the metro stop and back.  It could run on a loop every 10-15 minutes and would have to run only at rush hour.  I personally would like to take the metro to work but do not because there is currently not an efficient and reliable means of transportation from the metro station to the office.  Walking adds about 20 minutes and the route is not pedestrian-friendly, especially when carrying a company laptop and work materials or in the winter.  The Fairfax County buses do not take a direct route to Jones Branch and have other stops along the way of course so are not the most efficient.  I'm sure there are many team members that would utilize the metro if there were shuttle service to the office.  Encouraging the use of mass transit would be in keeping with Hilton's sustainability goals.  Without shuttle service to the office, I feel like the benefits of being relatively close to a metro stop are not fully realized.",521

The general consensus is of an individual who wears their feeling on a sleeve which causes hard feelings not to mention a very tense environment. This, in turn causes a very rigid and guarded atmosphere..   I have witnessed a situation where this manager felt it was ok to scream at a team member while other team members were in the same office. My manager screamed LIAR to my co-worker, over a belt pouch.  I have attended a pre-shift where this manager was verbalizing that another co-worker had received accolades, it would have been great if it would have stopped at that. Her next comment was how SHE (the manager) had been the one to make all arrangements but (in her words, whatever).    This is a person who constantly reminds her employees that praises should not be received for doing what is deemed as their assigned job, only when someone has gone above and beyond; Yet, she verbalizes how the employees don't appreciate what she does (purchasing equipment-part of her job-, purchasing linen-also part of her job, planning meetings-another part of her job, ect).  This is a manager who makes fun of her employees accents...  This is a manager who expects her employees to drop everything to come and cover, not for any emergency situation but to a lack of correct scheduling, should a person not be available there seems to be retaliatory actions in the form of scheduling employees in 9-10 day periods even though there's more that ""enough staff"" to cover.   This is a manager who regularly works 7-10 hours a day and barely any weekends, even though this is hospitality work.

That leaves my guest questioning.  And me as well.  I don't understand all the in's and out's of how revenue is made and MLOS,, but I do understand when my guest is frustrated because we both know there is a room to be had and he can't have it.

We often receive performance notifications by emails each month and we often get points and smiles all through the year, telling us how well we are performing, but when we get our annual assessments, we barely get a quarter as a raise. The pay as a full time hire doesn't meet the needs with the cost of living we have to endure. It is very low and yet more tasks are constantly being added to our job descriptions. As far as the health benefits, It is too costly considering the pay we receive and the fact that we can barely utilize it because we can't afford co-pays or the balances left after going to be seen at the Dr. Some families depend on just the income from Hilton full time employees. Hard to take care of a family not having competitive pay. We have to provide money for our own phones lines to do the job, and are not compensated for that...we also have to accept whatever hours available to work each week, which are slim and we do not receive shift differential for having to be stuck with only late hours. The system (BAS) states that we can work up to 12 hours each day, but there aren't even enough hours posted avail to take a 12 hour shift if that is what you choose to do. This is not building your schedule. To build your schedule, there should be options avail for you to select other than the same hours each day. These details make it very stressful and difficult to enjoy your job even when you want to. There are many elements that are great, but in these areas, I think Hilton would not have as many turn overs if employees could feel more job security and feel that they can take care of their families by working here.","While I love Hilton and it's amazing benefits, I would like to suggest having more option to those that are Building their Schedule. I was hired and told I would be able to build within my Core hours at all times. That has never been an issue until recently. I am now in Guest Assistance after moving from other departments. I was not told that Core Hours may not be available to me when I build my schedule. I noticed several days did not have any Core hours available to me in GA when I went to build. I couldn't build at all 3 days out of a week. I was only given an option to build on certain days and times, which made it seem more to me like a Set schedule. I also would like to have more Flexibility in GA being a BAS agent, as I always had in other departments. It would be nice to have more BAS options for Full time agents. If there were more opportunity to become a Full time GA agent with a BAS, then that would help out a lot of agents. GA seems to be busier than other desks, so maybe if more people were given an opportunity to become full time and build their schedule, then they would be properly staffed and if its too busy, lcv could always be offered for them and then would be able to take off work and Hilton wouldn't have to pay them. Just my thoughts. Also, it would be nice to have some hours outside of Core open up for agents weekly. Lastly, it would be nice to be able to switch departments even if you have not been on that particular desk for at least 3 months. Sometimes, an opportunity for a position you really wanted doesn't come available for a long time again, and if you have only been on a particular desk for less than 3 months, you cannot apply for it, so you miss out on an opportunity you have been wanting more than others. It would be nice to have no minimum call requirements for prizes for work giveaways by DC or Managers.

LCV should be offered more evenly, some desks seem to always have LCV available and some rarely have LCV offered.  The ""hotel desk"" system does not mean anything anymore, everyone gets calls from all areas of the country and yet LCV is still offered by desk assignment - perhaps a seniority system would work better.","I would appreciate a  DC (development coach)  who is available.   My current DC (reservations) is very difficult to contact  unless you download an app for your phone.   Normal calls to her office phone or emails are usually  not returned.  I have had questions that I have asked and they are not usually never answered.   I go to Kb  articles and other agents through chat.  My DC is very nice,  friendly and personable.  It's just that she's  not easy to connect with and when you do,  she talks about her own schedule/etc for the majority of the time.  Especially about how busy she is.     When I started at Hilton and went through training I really enjoyed the team spirit and being able to communicate  with everyone.  Once I was transitioned to the sales floor,  I feel more alone and not able to really reach out to anyone  when I have a question or issue that arises.   We meet once or twice a month for 15 minutes to a half hour.  Most of the time is spent on chit chat about my DC.     I go to other agents via chat to get answers if I can't  find the answer in a KB article.  I'm really disappointed.   I really enjoyed the training and team feel but that doesn't   seem to have continued once I was transitioned out of training.  A group meeting once a month to get everyone  on the team together would be great so we can touch base and connect.   I realize not everyone's schedule allows  that but surely we should be able to get most of the team together. I don't even know who else is on my team.    I love the job but I am disappointed with the team I am on.   I don't want to create issues so I do not request to go  to another team.  I do not want to have any problems at work .  I am very happy working for Hilton as a whole.   I am independent and am ok working alone.   It is just disappointing after the great training experience I had.","The reason I chose work/life balance is it is the closest I can come to one of the biggest hick-ups I see on almost a daily basis now that we are coming out of peak season.  That balance would be the LCV offered to different hotel desks and not across the board.  I understand that business needs are taken into consideration when LCV is offered, but what I don't get is that as soon as that is offered to one desk it may change the calls that we are getting.  As a Northeast agent I am gated to take those calls, which is not in fact the way the calls come.  I get calls from all over the country in any given hour.  Gated may mean one thing, but from an agents standpoint we are taking calls as needed. These are hotel desk calls please keep in mind I am not implying other desks like GA or CC.  Perhaps LCV should come to tenure employees first, based on years of service. I bet you would find less turnover if you gave agents another reason to stay here longer.  Agents with years of service LCV or ALCV.  It would balance my life better with a 40 hour a week job after 10+ years to be able to take some much needed time off.  Evern if it comes in the increments of 1 hour at the end of my shift based on business needs. Thank you~",605

Since they have came out with those to me they are always wrong. If a guest select the wrong number in the VOC it can mess up your whole percentage. I just do not think that your whole award should be based on the VOC & FCR scores. Sometimes people choose not to do the VOC & FCR and if they do then your percentage is low so you are not eligible for CTE. The award program need to be revisited and I think the supervisor should have more say so in that award. The scores are not accurate nor trustworthy. It is always something wrong with them and then they came out in the middle of the 2nd quarter and those numbers where still used to base if you get CTE or not. The award program is definitely something that needs work on because I work hard the whole quarter thinking I am going to make it and don't. It is really discouraging more than encouraging.,"VOC is a new metric we must now meet. All guests have always heard the prompt that their call is being recorded for quality assurance and to stay on the line  for a 2 question survey. They have always had the opportunity to express their feedback so nothing has changed for the guest.  As resv agents  we must now get a yes (1) for first question and a ""5"" for our second question.  Anything else, even a 4 is considered a failure. We also have a minimum percentage to meet. Some people  with never give a perfect score as they feel there is always room for improvement!  Also, most happy customers don't take time from their busy lives to take a survey.  This is something we cant force them to do this even though these surveys will now determine if we receive incentive money and pay raises . There is a minimum requirement of surveys to meet. This is especially difficult for those reservation agents who are leading in HGV/EHI transfers.    I understand VOC is important feedback for HILTON but it feels like another metric to worry about that we don't have a lot of control over.","The new VOC added to our monthly stats is simply unfair!

That really made employees excited to work hard on raising their conversion, ADR, and overall Revenue for the company! The monthly incentive program that we have currently with ""scorecard"" is just not motivating at all.  I want to be motivated and that can be done by giving us a much greater incentive, aka iEarn 2.0.","Working from home and Go Hilton. ** I use to like my pay. That is until the program changed and I started losing money. I understand and respect that iearn 2.0 was a temporary program, however it was canceled without warning. When we started it I was under the impression that if the program went well it would be implemented within the company. Everyone seemed to be performing excellently and those that were not doing their part stopped getting their HGV money doubled. I would think that would be a plus. If they aren't providing the service and upselling then they should not be getting the money. Being paid with RPC was so much better. You guys send out emails about how much money we are bringing in but then you cut the program that was allowing me to financial survive??? I work so hard to provide exceptional service and to perform at the highest expectations. Yet, I'm still only paid at a little over 10 an hour and by bonuses are no longer able to make up the difference. I know my opinion on this does not matter. I know I am just a warm body that is replaceable. I know nothing will change. My morale use to be much higher. However when the decision was made to cut a program that recognized and paid us for our hard work, I lost respect for the company. It left me with the impression that we are not valued or respected. I've worked for other companies that no only give a yearly raise, but also a cost of living raise. I need to be paid better or I will have to find another job that is able to help me provide for my family. I have been looking. Many of us have the same complaints and many of us have been trying to find something the provides the same option of being at home for flexibility and more pay. Right now American Express starts out at 16 an hour plus commission. I would be happy with you guys taking my bonuses away and just paying me a flat hourly rate of 16 an hour. at least it would be consistent and dependable. Please HELP US!!!!",298
WFO,ManagementBucket, Below Manager,395.060283688,9.56055481053e-31,26,386,I don't have any improvements but my main two concerns it would be better accessibility to doing my BAS schedule and having the opportunity to work more hours part time. First with the BAS is great but I have to plan vacations around a Thursday because I need to be able to make my schedule and get the hours I need since is critical for me as a stay at home mom that I get certain hours while my kids are at school. I wish there was an app or website that we could go to without having to log in Hilton's system to make a schedule when not working. Also I wish we could work more than 29 hours in a given week or make it more accessible. WFO is very hard to maneuver through and I have tried to pick up OT but it always fails. I wish OPS could do something like LCV but instead for OT. Like send an email with high volume hours and we can sign up with OPS since its difficult in WFO.,"Staff need the ability to BAS outside the system, most employees have other jobs and are not able to build at 7am. Also, it is sometimes difficult to BAS when on vacation or away from home.  It would be nice to use the WFO app to BAS.  LCV should be offered more evenly, some desks seem to always have LCV available and some rarely have LCV offered.  The ""hotel desk"" system does not mean anything anymore, everyone gets calls from all areas of the country and yet LCV is still offered by desk assignment - perhaps a seniority system would work better.",I would love for us to be able to BAS through WFO. Technology is changing daily and I think its time for us at Hilton to catch up. WFO is awesome just need a little enhancing. Also I think WFO needs to be changed LCV shows all green then when you submit it denies it hopefully we can get a better system going.,412
DCs,ManagementBucket, Below Manager,379.865657392,1.48616024554e-29,25,517,"I would like to see off phone training with excel and power point and advancement. When you see jobs opening they all required more advance knowledge of different applications. If you haven't bee exposed to them in another work place. If there are older adults in the work place. You can be intimidated all the extra requirements needed. If you want to retain good employees give them the tools to make them more helpful in the work place. New software, new systems are put our that have little to no training on. For example rocket chat, wfm ( empower) I cant understand, it only would be beneficial to everyone that works for the company, and resmart  which is completely useless, if you ask me.. never had any information in that application. The help desk are a joke now. I don't even bother calling. Most I cant understand them.","The training and development program needs a complete overhaul--new hires are not anywhere near operational levels when they complete training.  OJT should be given back to the individual department's operational DCs to help get new hires up to speed.  The trainers do not have the correct training and operational experience to be teaching the new hires.  They should be involved in calibration with operational DCs to stay current on operational expectations and needs.   New Hire training should be more strict in terms of attendance and availability.  When I was trained 5 years ago, if you missed one day of training, you were gone.  Now they come in with attendance and availability issues and they are unprepared to build and adhere to a schedule, which is critical with work@home staff.    Technical support continues to be a challenge and tools we need daily to do our jobs are not working properly.  Yet, team members and DCs are held to the same standards, effecting pay and disciplinary issues, whether these systems are working or not.  On top of that, we are expected to compete with other teams that have the new technology when we don't have that technology, which is unfair.  Not enough is being done to communicate operational needs/issues to senior leadership and/or apologies/compensation delivered when things are known not to be working and affecting pay and job performance.","I have been at Hilton for almost 17 years and I have been a DC for many of those years.  I have had some OUSTANDING leaders and peers.  However, I absolute do not feel comfortable with the team I am currently a part of.  I feel the tone trickles down from Senior leadership.  Managing with fear, favorites, and distrust sets the tone for the team. Our Senior Manager, Virginia Lozano-Weber, who at one point I fully trusted and respected, causes a great division amongst our team.  While she sends me to workshops that encourage a culture change and encourages us to challenge process, she really does not support it unless it is something she agrees with.  This has become very evident in meetings we hold with her as she is very withdrawn if she feels we ""challenge her"" or if we question processes that she may support.  I do not think it is a positive example when she uses terms like ""invisible wall"" to describe an unspoken separation.  I just wish she will be more conducive to supporting our group team efforts and not make things an ""us"" vs. ""them"" type of environment.  As a result of this management style my fellow DCs will not share projects they are working on, we do not work together to make our department successful unless our direct manager gives instructions, I also believe she discourages the DCs on QA and HD, not to respond nor communicate amongst each other.  Our senior leaders need to develop the talent within our company instead of always looking outside.  If our VPs want degrees or think that those who have degrees are more valuable, this needs to be relayed to the masses.  I received my associates degree and now almost complete with my studies for my Bachelors in business management.  I do not feel the same support nor investment that I see with the college recruits and new DC hires.    One side note: I just wish my Senior Manager and Manager would be more open to the DCs of our department being virtual without a requirement to come onsite (excluding meetings).",542

That leaves my guest questioning.  And me as well.  I don't understand all the in's and out's of how revenue is made and MLOS,, but I do understand when my guest is frustrated because we both know there is a room to be had and he can't have it.  I know this is a hotel thing and not so much  ""Hilton"" thing, but maybe you can help us out by giving us a better answer than ""Sorry, it's so we don't inconvenience the guest.""

FCR,ManagementBucket, Below Manager,334.281778505,5.53467883412e-26,22,409,The CTE award is a great tool but the VOC & FCR scores do not be accurate. Since they have came out with those to me they are always wrong. If a guest select the wrong number in the VOC it can mess up your whole percentage. I just do not think that your whole award should be based on the VOC & FCR scores. Sometimes people choose not to do the VOC & FCR and if they do then your percentage is low so you are not eligible for CTE. The award program need to be revisited and I think the supervisor should have more say so in that award. The scores are not accurate nor trustworthy. It is always something wrong with them and then they came out in the middle of the 2nd quarter and those numbers where still used to base if you get CTE or not.

They have always had the opportunity to express their feedback so nothing has changed for the guest.  As resv agents  we must now get a yes (1) for first question and a ""5"" for our second question.  Anything else, even a 4 is considered a failure. We also have a minimum percentage to meet. Some people  with never give a perfect score as they feel there is always room for improvement!  Also, most happy customers don't take time from their busy lives to take a survey.  This is something we cant force them to do this even though these surveys will now determine if we receive incentive money and pay raises . There is a minimum requirement of surveys to meet.

We run very thinly on the ground in the hotels, which generates challenges for HR as there are not many capable leaders or assistant managers who have the time, ability or capability to deliver and support the HR function.

I believe everyone is doing the best they can; however, our leader in the HWS group space gives the impression that no matter what you give you've fallen short.

I think communication of the changes and a phase of consolidation would be great.","Is this the only area we now have to make comments in? There is a clear problem forming in the consolidation and centralization of power in the company.  We have tons of positions being added in the main offices and it is beginning to annoy or scare people in the field.  This is creating another problem in the forming of inner circles where information gets trapped in these circles and not disseminated out to the people who need it.  There are people in these offices that also are more likely to withhold information and not share with others.  The only reasons this could happen might be lack of self-confidence so information becomes power, incapable of understanding what to share or purposefully withheld for whatever ends whether via incompetence or maliciously.  We need to stop this heavy centralization, or the normal cycle will occur in the not so far future, and we'll eliminate a ton of those centralized jobs and flood the field with their extra work and responsibilities again.  It's also terrible that we keep adding all these positions, spending tons of money flying Execs places for one day meetings, and any number of the other ways we waste money so easily, and allow our soldiers to travel well (i.e. Business Class for 6+ hour flights for Directors and Snr Managers).  Those are the people fighting the fight and they should be able to arrive fresh to any long haul destination they need to travel to.","Add more corporate accounting staff.

In addition, we must work national holidays, especially July 4th, which is the biggest summer holiday usually spent with family and friends.  When we introduced SST all of the consolidation and reporting for the company went into one system. This should have saved time in that area allowing us to take off on holidays.

Disruption in client relationships, work mode and morale has been the result with the last 2 sales leaders.  Now we have another leader and their ""vision/legacy"" they are imprinting on the company....overall morale is not good, account transitions are not positive and goal setting is completely off mark with the changes.  And to earn a bonus anymore with the formulas and the incentive compensation program is really driving morale down and deflating.  How much more confusing and harder are they going to make the bonus structure to even make annually what we were making 5 years ago?  And salary increases annually are so minimal that we are still not paid industry average and up on the inflation rate.  We are expected to sell rates at 12% increase, but we are not paid in comparison the inflation that our company is charging at their properties.","The Sales/Catering side of the organization continues to hand out Senior Director titles like they are candy.  All of the new hires from the Sales/Catering organization have joined the regional team with a Senior Director title.  Meanwhile, the Revenue Management team primarily carries Director titles even though we carry very similar responsibilities for our respective disciplines.  This is extremely demotivating.      On top of the lack of title (which negatively impacts our LTI and Bonus), the base compensation for our role is just silly.  The gap between us and our Sales counterparts has been and continues to be ridiculous (I'm not arguing it should be the same but it should be much closer!).  Now we have on property DRMs with much higher base compensation.  So when the top talent in the field makes more than we do, there is a problem.  This also creates bench strength problems as well.  When we need to hire new team members for the regional team, the top talent in the field to pull from will   1:  Out price themselves from the RDRM role which means we have to now fill our team with non-top talent because that's all we can afford  or  2:  We pay for top talent which then means the legacy team members on the regional team continue to be under compensated.      And so the cycle never ends.  I am fortunate enough that I enjoy my job, I enjoy the team, but should I ever choose to pursue one of these recruiters that always tap me on the shoulder, if the compensation is better, it will be hard to say no.  Also, please don't think the team lives in an ignorant bubble and is not aware of this.  There have been comments made by a number on the team that imply we don't know what others make.  That simply is not true.  While we don't engage in conversation about compensation on a daily basis, the team has a good understanding of the issues presented above.",1593
flights,ManagementBucket, Director/Sr.Director,48.3583386493,9.90586897945e-29,54,90,"The travel policy should take into account travel duration, not just job level, for business class airfare.  It is difficult to be productive after flying 6+ hours in coach.  There should be additional allowances for long-distance/international travel.  A recommendation would be to negotiate a program with our preferred airline partners for corporate travel.  I have worked for large companies that had additional benefits for employees that included 4 complimentary upgrades per year and lounge access. This would allow non-VP level Team Members to upgrade their travel at no additional cost to the company for at least some of those longer/international flights.","Please consider allowing all employees to fly business class for long-haul flights (e.g., flights to Asia from the US). The current policy only allows VP level and above to fly business class, and 24-hour one-way trips can be difficult - flying in economy makes it difficult to be get work done, and the recovery time at the destination after a 24-hour flight is much longer, which impacts productivity.","Air travel policy. i travel very frequently and have to work on the plane in order to keep up with my workload, to be expected do this in economy on long journey's is unfair, especially when limited options mean you can only take a night flight. Taking time off either side is simply not an option nor efficient in order to keep up with the volume. This is the key area in my role that makes me feel as an individual and the work I do to be undervalued. I fully understand the necessity for such a policy, however there should be flexibility to recognize the individual challenges arising from the nature of a specific job. An interesting benchmark is often the reaction of owners and others, usually of surprise. Again to be clear I only refer to flights +5hrs or similar, plus 'difficult' destinations. Clearly this would be difficult to change across the board, but should be reevaluated based on the nature of each job, frequency of flying, what is the reason ie. meeting owners and needing to be fresh, alert and professional. Could some roles be weighted?    Quality of offices (Dubai). I know we are looking to move to a new base, but this has been talked about for a long time. The work environment is acceptable, however of greater concern is the guest experience when third parties visit.

The team members have to work longer hours and work on weekends/holidays to support projects to make sure that they get delivered.,"I believe that how some of the recent structural changes were handled was very poor. People lost jobs due to bad planning, the communication was poor, the reason for the changes or how the change would actually happen wasn't properly explained and mapped out. How this was handled made the process much more painful than it should have been.     Leadership seems to favor those with revenue management experience who get vast majority of major promotions whilst other functions are left out. Some not getting the promotions they deserve, despite strong performance or expanded scope of work.    Company is generally too under resourced and always too focused on controlling the number of head count. Things are made worse due to many positions left vacant for extended period of time. There is also no compensation for those covering for those vacancies despite having to put long hours to do so. Hope company will hire more junior team members to help with workload, as many managers and above spend a lot of time doing administrative work.     I feel that despite consecutive years of poor GTMS scores, there has been little to no action taken to resolve any of the issues. There has been zero communication from leadership on what they have done to improve. (outside of global initiatives such as Thrive and Go Hilton).","We as a team have grown very quickly and quite large over the last few years, and are anticipated to keep growing at a quick pace. While we've done what we can to build processes and tools to help us to support growth of this scale, we are in desperate need of investment in new tools and platforms to help keep up with the demands of supporting business processes for such a large team.

This can take a lot of effort and time and this is not often seen by others. At the end of the day the properties may still have many challenges and issues even though we have tried so much to improve them, there are just limitations on consultants, contractors and Owners capabilities on certain projects and in certain regions. But importantly I believe this is very well understood by my management, as they are also engineers who have had a similar role and so can therefore understand the challenges I face, which is good to know. The internal Hilton team members are all exactly that, it is a team effort and I feel everyone contributes and understands the difficulties of others.",The management and running of major projects is pretty poor. I have been involved in 2 major projects over the course of 2017 and neither has been adequately resourced. My team and I have had to work excessive hours for weeks & months at a time in order to complete the projects.  There is also a tendency to rely too much on consultants advice.

The process is underway, but I don't think filling the positions has been as quick or easy as planned. Between the project load, Project HUB, travel, and monthly status meetings, it is really tough to keep up with everything. I often find myself neglecting one thing to take care of another.    Secondly, I think getting all of our technology integrated will help with some of the above problems, and keep our entire team on the same page.

Project HUB has been great, but the process of reviewing plans, etc. is still a bit muddled.

However, this isn't the key to really thriving in today's environment  -- a great concept, but someone should be aware that among TMs this is an office ""joke"", because it is perceived as a great HR marketing campaign to gain quality employees and drive Hilton to the top of the Best Places to Work charts -- The reality is that the matrix organization structure, and sparse staffing to work ratio doesn't really allow for quality recharge time -- PTO would be more beneficial if you didn't have to work so hard before you go and when you come back -- it often feels like punishment to take PTO; very few totally unplug during vacation, including our leaders. Hard to convince one's self to unplug when Sr. Leaders don't walk this talk.    Maybe the organization should consider twice a year sabbaticals for all team members -- shut the office down for a week at a time (Summer/Winter), like Chinese New Year, so that everyone has a real chance to relax and not be worried about the 700+ emails you'll need to dig through when you come back.

Being able to make a difference on a larger level then just as a GM on the property,"Communication on our team is lacking, we work in silos of our disciplines. On monthly huddles and team call we get a 2-minute update from departments but usually its numbers; those are important, but do not help me support my hotels. Recently at owner's conference as part of our prep we received updates from Honors, Go Hilton, Digital, to name a few. I learned more in that session than I have all year about what is going on and information I can use to help my hotels. When new initiatives are rolled out the message includes a reference to contact BPS Support with questions but so many times we don't know the answers.  If we change the format of our calls to include guests to give updates which would allow us to ask questions; have the different BPS disciplines share what they have done to drive results. When we have a team meeting let BPS plan the content instead of Hospitality. We have had meetings that I do not feel were productive, we have come up with ideas but there is no follow up.   I believe there is some favoritism on the team. Several people have the VP of BPS as a Mentor. That is great however; those are the same team members that are often singled out for recognition. We get a lot of praise as a team but there are others on the team that should be singled out as well. In addition, those people who have him as a mentor make it known that they can go directly to him and get things done. My perception is that if you live in Memphis or have a close relationship with the VP you can go directly to him bypassing your immediate supervisor, he acts on those discussions without involving the Sr. Directors or getting more information. I know we have an open door policy,  but in order for that to work effectively when someone goes to the VP with a concern or idea he should involve the appropriate Sr. Director of team member, then proceed.

Priorities and communications do not flow throughout the organization the way we would expect them too, specific focus should be made to improve messaging.  The volume and number of communication vehicles are overwhelming.  The lobby, email, HU, Buzz, Group boards etc etc.  Increased leverage of video messaging could assist in delivering more content faster.    Career assistance is needed, for individuals to help our more junior personnel figure out what path they want to take, understand the organizational processes required to make them happen, and give them the tools to help make it happen themselves.  HR and Career processes are opaque and often dependent on who you know not performance or otherwise determined.  More organizational agility to move talent between functions will lead to increased innovation and collaboration.  Lastly, specific focus has to be put on not trying to make female employees function / work like their male peers in order to get ahead / enter leadership ranks.  Even female executives have been known to use negative comparisons to male peers (tone of voice, emotional etc) as excuses for not giving females the opportunities.

The change in sales conversely where Sales leaders were devolved back to property has been massively successfully operationally allowing these TMs to be focused on Hotel priorities as well as supporting fewer but more impactful central initiative.

Our managers have no sense of understanding of where their employees are coming from, no empathy to the situations we have to go through due to the simple fact that they, themselves, put us in. Can't really get a clear answer from them, from them not understanding or simply not caring. I suggest that us as an entity to receive more appreciation, more positive reinforcements instead of negative let downs. Managers and Directors are unappreciative. We would hear something negative way before we hear anything positive. Anytime we do get recognition for our hard work, it sounds rehearsed and painful for them to say it. I suggest managers take classes that improve them on how to speak to their employees. Majority of our bosses are rude and disrespectful. Uncultured at the very most and aren't fairly familiar with words that shouldn't be said to certain ethnic groups/races. They demean women in more ways than one and it's pretty disturbing to work in such an environment. Lack of management involvement in other shifts' duties and making sure everything is done to completion. Workload to employee ratio isn't fair. Employees are diminishing, pay doesn't accommodate for the work we put in. Workplace discrimination is allowed and I find it unacceptable. There's not a day that goes by without other employees telling my coworkers that they ""need a man"" for certain situations. Everybody applied through the same application, agreed to lift the same certain amount and everything. If our workload is too much for women, then we shouldn't have so much right? The women outnumbers the men, it's not fair to kill the men with the work that people think the women couldn't handle honestly. Workload increases, not enough employees to handle it all, not paid to accommodate the labor we put out.","Some of the senior managers of our department are very rude, inappropriate, condescending, and demeaning.  One in particular does nothing but get in the way, and attempt to ascert her dominance and prove her value.  We also do not feel comfortable ever going to human resources, because managers and senior managers have clear and obvious relationships and friendships with the people inside of human resources.  Utilizing human resources seems like a great way to shoot oneself in the foot.  There should be clear rules about the engagement between human resoures and managers.",668

He just looks for his own benefits and moves on. Most of the time (75%) he is not found at his workplace. Jobs/ activity are given randomly to anyone without proper information. No guidelines provided about how can the task be completed. Does favouritism and has created bad work atmosphere. He will ask to take oneself own decision and if the decision goes wrong the person is blamed for taking decision. He should be with the staff if any urgent work needs to be done, but he at home and the staff in office till late night breaking their head on the task. Most of the staff is desperate to move out of this property because of such behaviour. Does not favour the staff in any ways. I spoke to him about my career growth for last 1 year but get false promises. Does not conduct team building programs. I feel like never again to work under his leadership who speaks something and has something else in his mind. Such an HOD will never built a team    HR is one more of concern. Decision are taken overnight on staff facilities without informing the staff. Hence the staff had to suffer the consequences. Slowly and steadily, seems like staff benefits will removed.    GM is also a concern. Never will you find him speaking politely and making a person understand what mistake he has done and help him to rectify it. He like to insult in public by shouting on top of his voice. A smallest of mistake is made issue or made faces. I don't think this is how a leader should be    Concern on salary part. during our selection as staff, we had negotiated the salary ( not having any idea of service charge ) but the service charge came as inclusive in the negotiated salary. Now that service charge is slowly vanishing in India, we are back to square one. The impact of increments we received during the years is almost the same of the salary we had started to work with.

I would like to see more of a balance in the treatment, as well as a balance in the benefits and compensation. Being forced to take PTO on national holidays while union members get holiday pay on top of days off is a very hard pill to swallow.","Currently the big discussion in our office is whether we will have a job next year.  Due to corporate trying to map the workload and procedures as out in Europe; outsourcing some work areas from the department many employees are afraid their job could be gone.  The meetings that our boss has attended about some changes, and not really able to say much as he indicated leaves the office with low morale.  Additionally, due to required goals by the current owner, another issue as to whether the hotel might still be a Hilton in 2018.  There have been numerous Hilton properties in 2017 that are no longer Hiltons.  Unfortunately, there are not many suggestions for improvement as the changes are handled through the Hilton corporate level and there determination will be the final result.  While corporate does report to shareholders, it is still important that corporate realizes the employees are an important asset of the hotel.  Without the dedication of the employees to the guests, the salt scores drop.  It is an unfortunate concept that when new hotels open up, many guests try the new property; some like it others come back.  One of the drawbacks at our property is that is a union hotel and for some reason the unions put the squeeze to the hotels for pay and benefits.  Their increases force the non-union employees not to really a good increase, increase cost to their insurance coverage and take home pay.  Additionally, to ensure profiabiltiy, required PTO days are requested, but then workloads are placed on the shoulders of the other employees due to corporate timetables.  Many times employees are requested to do task force at other properties, but then again those workloads are passed off to other employees.","Health benefits for those with HMSA; ridiculous rates.  Hilton needs to work more diligentlly to secure better rates and not blame the number of people we loss that made the group smaller hence higher rate.  Retirees to receive health benefits like the union.  After all its non-union that you call upon when Hotel has a crisis.    Rainbow Bazaar needs renovation; it's wooden and has wood rot, termite damage,very unsightly for our guests and TM to see. Walkways are slippery and uneven.

bad,ManagementBucket, I choose not to disclose,1.83656414325,8.71369154643e-13,676,588,"The managerial situation is dire. It has been lousy the entirety of my tenure at the company, but lately seems to have become even worse. Our current manager has had one foot out the door for months now, yet never leaves. It seems as if they are disinterested in their job; leave early frequently; oftentimes have a short fuse, etc and that creates chaos.     The hiring/employment situation is also ridiculous. A parade of terrible, unreliable employees have been hired by this manager. They often don't last more than a month and are incapable of doing their job. I--personally--have referred THREE people to apply here. All of them are more than qualified; college-educated, mature adults. NOT ONE OF THEM WAS EVEN GRANTED AN INTERVIEW. When I asked both my GM and HR about this, their response was simply that ""they must not have passed our prerequisites to work here."" Umm...judging from the people who've come through the revolving door here over the last year and a half, I can't imagine what those pre-requisites must be. It's almost like the management doesn't want intelligent, capable help or that they are afraid hiring people on an even intellectual playing field will challenge their authority. In any case, it has left a bad taste in my mouth re: Hilton as a place to work.     In addition to these issues, it seems that the rules change on a daily basis--back and forth, and back again.     Certain employees are held to MUCH higher standards than others, and when this is brought up to GM it is met with hostility/iciness.    Scheduling is RIDICULOUS. I am often scheduled between 6-10 days CONSECUTIVELY, but the days are arranged so that I never receive any overtime. It is impossible to ever count on having a weekend off. In my department, one employee has been promised weekends off and gets them 95% of the time. My days off are routinely weekdays, When I've brought up having a consistent 2 days off so I could get a part-time job elsewhere to boost income, this was not warmly rec'd.","Pay increase.

Head of department are just here to sit in office and wait for others to do job. She is rude and never cares about her team. She should take example of her deputy. Here is no team work, WGC work for them, Hilton is separate. what has happened here? Looks like General manager even do not see that this department is falling apart, no people who can clean rooms, supervisors barley speak English, no proper training, team is with low moral and upset.

I believe that the position was specifically designed and made for a security supervisor named Kerry. Kerry holds a ""supervisor"" title but does not supervise. Her title and position is a waste of company money. She is suppose to supervise the shift but she does not. The morning shift has a junior officer supervise in the event of the absence of the team.     There have been TOO MANY employees that got offered to resign when they should've been fired. Security Guard David Ramos stole guest property but was offered to resign by the security director.    A housekeeper stole guest property, quitted when confronted, and is now back at work. The guest and the police arrived at the houseman's home and they discovered that the houseman had the guest's property at the houseman's home. The employee is now back at work.    A front office manager stole from the hotel and disneyland desk but was offered to resign.    A front office manager criminally allowed a non guest to use a guest key to stay in a fake hotel room and the incident led to a criminal investigation. The manager was allowed to quit.    A bar staff stole money out of a guest wallet and when confronted he quit.    These employees should have been fired! They should have been fired and not given a chance to reemploy with the Hilton company. One manager now works for a Hilton property and the other works for another Hilton property.

Ridiculous way the department is ran. The director is wrapped up by the Day Shift Supervisor named Kerry. She was made a position called ""Admin Supervisor"". Completely unethical decision making on behalf of the Security Director, Human Resources Director, and Hotel Manager.     You cannot file a complaint or inquiry with the Human Resources Director due to the fact that she would only take the side of the Security Director.

Help arrived after the security guards complained about this inadequate support during the Focus Group Meeting with the General Manager. Officers are now left with trauma and it is too late to provide the help to the officers.     Neither Security Director or Human Resource Director made the decision to immediately take the employees out of the field following the incidents.    The security director went home promptly in one of the Death cases as if he didn't care about the involved officers and hotel staff.    It is a JOKE.

Instead we roll out the same old tired events every year.  Nothing new are inovative.  The hotels appearance is not kept up at all, it looks way more dated than the eight years its been open.      Furthermore I do not feel that my management team actually gives two hoots about my department.  I feel that we are looked upon as more of a burden and nusance than anything.  There is next to no interest shown in our direction unless someone screws something up.  My director does not know how to show up on time (or atleast what is scheduled).  How can anyone be held accountable for attendance when they are not.     Honestly I can keep going on but what is the point.  The same stuff gets said every year, and consistantly every year there is absoultly nothing done about it.  This entire survey process is designed to give the impression to the lay person that our opinion matters, when people with half a brain know that it doesn't truly matter.  As long as the hotel keeps making money and the people at the top are bringing it in nothing will change.  It's a totally frutless process that amounts to nothing in th end.

This last season we experienced some positive changes but we need to keep focusing on how to treat our employees better so that the morale can go up and they can be motivated in giving a luxury service to guests.

It seems as though our department struggles to move along at the same pace. There is always a reason why we are not doing what the Crave emails tout. When it comes to the things that make a career in the 2010s work, we are 'too busy', or 'there's a deadline', or 'it doesn't work with our department structure'.     Our department requires very specialized knowledge, and we should push to be more flexible to attract talent in a market where our specialty is in demand.

I think we are pointed in the right direction, but offering and advertising our flexibility -combined with Hilton's favorable showings in top places to work lists- has the potential to make this the most in-demand department in our area. We should be focused on a mentality of working efficiently instead of working more. While it may legit be more difficult to be flexible in our working environment than many other areas, it sounds like an excuse and does not build the goodwill necessary for retention. Simple things like sending people home at 4 on Fridays when we are not in a crunch time go a long way.     I think we must also mention communication.

HSLT to communicate new HSM 2.0 strategy, so teams may utilize information to develop divisional team strategies (short & long term). No line of sight being provided. HSLT to provide vision, mission, & value statements that will drive total business strategy and team members can begin to implement. HSLT to listen to divisional business opportunities presented by team members and issue resources in form of headcount and technology, where business cases exist to drive increases revenue and cost savings. Our team has been overlooked time and again for investment, even though a viable business case has been presented on multiple occasions showing the triple digit growth rate that has caused our team members to become overworked and burnt out. Seems that HSLT is only investing in areas that are new opportunities and not dealing with the pain and suffering being realized today from exponential growth in the industry. HSLT to show that they care about all the team members in HSM, and not just the new hires that were brought in for the transformation to HSM 2.0. HSLT to review all team members compensation and bring up to market value making HSM a desired place to work for top outside talent knowing that we take care of our people, as well as keeping the top performers. secured for long term by providing recognition and monetary incentives equivalent to the Supply Chain industry. All team members are being well underpaid and overworked, when compared to published market statistics. HSLT develop strategy to get HSM its own seat on the Executive Committee, no longer reporting to Human Resources (conflict of interest), where we are including in the business planning and strategy of the business making what we do more effective by having this position report directly to Chris Nassetta CEO.","73. What improvements do you suggest? CONTINUED 1: HSLT to become more strategically aligned with the Brands, in order to develop a formal project & scheduling process so our teams no longer have to drop everything with last minute high priority requests that cause workflow distribution and are delivered by the Brands in an unorganized undocumented uncontrolled process. Need to become more strategic with how each department engages with Supply Management, so our workflow is not impacted by unscheduled projects and events. HSLT to invest in mobile devices for managers or above that need to be connected throughout the day to the business. More technology, systems, and hardware. HSLT to invest in artificial intelligence, so we can take our game to next level from a business intelligence standpoint. HSLT to invest in a real procure-to-pay system to replace Birch Street, so HSM can sell a SaaS platform for purchasing and reporting to the properties closing gaps in garbage data into our systems from third party relied upon suppliers and distributors. HSM data is out right awful to point where Tableau is useless for reporting, because the data is not enriched properly on the front end and we have no control of our destiny. HSLT to replace legacy non-IT experienced team members with young IT educated and experienced team members with greater computer science & business analytics capabilities and vision. Very clear that the wrong talent in GBS/IT heavily weighs on our capabilities in the new world of digitization and business intelligence that will continue to be our Achilles heel until resolved.

I had an office in my prior job, and I realize it isn't realistic for the majority of team members to have offices, but I personally would appreciate a somewhat less open cubicle area.

Of course we need to adopt local/regional culture and their realistic situation, however the balance between keeping Hilton global standard and adjustment locally is of paramount importance. Regional team should be more supportive to deliver the global standard rather than sacrificing and compromising from the first instance.

No clear growth opportunities, lack of recognition and there are no learning activities (in 3 years, I never attended a conference, or done a course online related to my job function). I don't see myself working in this team in the future and I have tried to move to other departments within the company with no success, because my skills do not look transferable. It's very disappointing and frustrating, because in general, I think Hilton is a great place to work but the finance department is not. My manager and her manager are great but I see them struggling with how things are working out.  I would suggest more relationship with HR, more services for individuals to speak up. And exit interviews with HR.  Changing topic, the location of the headquarters' office is not ideal. Metro is nearby but the distance is not walkable (and in some parts, no sidewalks!). A shuttle from 7.30 am to 9.30 am and from 4.30 pm to 7 pm would represent a great relief for many employees who take the metro, and would encourage others to take public transportation instead of driving.","I would love to see Memphis Corporate offices get a renovation - I feel like the inside of the buildings are dated to the 90s.

Compared to Dallas and McLean our campus interiors look old, tired and mash up of different design themes.  Some consistency would benefit these buildings greatly and the impression we give off to our owners, MCRs, visiting hotel team members.","Being in a ""remote"" office our team doesn't get the benefits of the corporate offices which is difficult. As someone managing a team I have to do additional work to make the team feel part of corporate. I would be nice to be included in more of hte corporate events and plans so I don't have to spend additional hours doing so.

Ideally,ManagementBucket, Manager/Sr.Manager,26.7525689874,8.61471423638e-07,14,55,"Any help with child care would be great.  It's such a huge expense.  Compensation increases annually haven't taken into account the significant increase in the cost of living in Dallas, so I've noticed more people feel financially pinched and are moving farther away from the office to afford nice housing and schools.  I don't know what the solution is, but my hope is that someday we have a Hilton campus in a more suburban community - Plano, Frisco, Keller, etc.  to help reduce commute and housing costs.    Beyond benefits, I have some thoughts on culture and structure. As we seem to be moving more and more towards standardization and consistency, we need to make sure our leadership and support teams are really plugged in to the job our Analysts and Specialists are doing. The decisions we make and the expectations we have need to be fair (tasks can reasonably be done in 40 hours/week) and consistent (no mixed messages from leadership/support teams).  Otherwise, we'll breed contempt and resentment towards leadership who is""out of touch"" with the work our people are doing.  That's the quickest way to become just another corporate employer.      One big piece that frustrates many of our team members is the difficulty in moving to a new cubicle.  It seems we should be able to find a solution that allows for easier/more frequent moves as needed.  The value of having a manager near their team members (ideally sharing a row) can't be overstated, in my opinion.  Teams should have proximity, and our managers shouldn't have to walk all over the floor to check in on their team members.  Being closer would foster camaraderie, pod strength, and accountability.","I feel as though communication overall to the general organization is much needed.  Often times, things are cascaded with not enough consideration to the overall change management.  It makes it difficult for our leaders to speak with their direct reports regarding what's coming down the pipeline and re-establish expectations.  I'd like to see stronger and more thoughtful communication plans in every aspect of change.  Ideally, structured timelines for rollout expectations, advanced notification will benefit team member at all levels.  We're showing improvement with this and getting there slowly, but there is still much more work to go in the way of advanced communication.","Ideally less fire drills. Seems as though many times these drills are driven from the top down. It's challenging to not have enough of a head's up to get things organized, planned or done in a timely manner.

restaurant,ManagementBucket, Non-Management,1.67254730317,1.07621915586e-11,691,4286,"Unfortunately, the ""status quo"" in our restaurant's kitchen has not only created, but also fostered an atmosphere which often places the guest secondary to it's function.  Considering how seasonal our operation is, we cannot seem to capitalize on guest experience and revenue at key times of year.  Staple menu items are regularly 86'd; a nearly empty dining room often goes on a wait to accommodate business levels for the bar and GSD; kitchen staffing levels never change to reflect occupancy needs; kitchen management is extremely opinionated and out of touch with staff and especially, guests true needs...positive consistency instead of the contrary!              I've patiently waited for a professional venue to share my thoughts, as a 32 year vet of F&B.  Thanks.","Continue our progressive approach to hospitality by making our guest number one.  I am impressed with the leadership roles all my managers take. Since Shiela Foley became General manager there are so many improvements that have been  made to the property. For instance I put on freshly laundered uniform that she helped choose in a comfortable contemporary locker room that she helped re-decorate with toiletries on the sink to insure great grooming. After setting our well maintained dining room, I joined our employees in an employee cafeteria, that has the charm of a freestanding restaurant, with five large screen TV's to give diners a chance to relax with different viewing options. Tonight's dinner of Moussaka and Spanakopia was characteristic of the range and quality our culinary staff provides. I also look at the caliber of employees she hires and their striving for perfection. Chris Fava, our Director of Food and Beverage is making improvement to our Sunday Brunch that is receiving accolades from our guests. Our world class chef Brian Peterson, is innovative with an amazing ability to create a fusion recipes that borrow from the native Americans and Spanish whose cultures  influenced our regional cuisine. Tim Jesson our Assistant Director of Food and Beverage created program that pays homage to our resorts roots with special drinks  in a speakeasy setting. Our manager, Dolan Olson should be recognized for the extraordinaire talent he brings to his job, amazing knowledge of food and wine  combines with his ability to bring out the best in his entire staff as well. His graciousness, attention to detail and professionalism makes him highly regarded by guests and employees alike.Mark Yeager our Beverage manager is sharing with our staff his wide knowledge.of wines as he pursues his Master Sommelier title.  Cara Langley, our assistant manager brings an enthusiasm to her positon that elevates all around her. In so many ways I am fortuna to work in such a great  environment.","I feel we need improvements everywhere.   Cafeteria: We need to to change the menu more often. We need to have specials. We need to improve the way we serve food(ex., not keeping food hot all day in a box. Instead, cook it to order like the way a restaurant works.) There needs to be better cooking techniques involved with the food (ex., instead of steaming everything, blanch or boil instead. Not overproducing food so that it gets repeated for several days in a row.    Senior leadership: Where is the GM? I haven't seen the GM since the day I was hired, which was the middle of May. It doesn't feel like the senior leaders are doing their part in being seen, known, or contributing to the growth of the hotel.    Performance Review process:  I was given my review which turned out great, but where do I go from here? I haven't had any advice in career growth, or interest shown by management in any type of positive guidance.     Training and development: I feel like there are certain managers and and myself who care about the training of new and current employees, but I feel that the Senior manager doesn't do anything about it. The only reason I say this is because I've seen the same mistakes and general attitude of certain employees even after I've addressed it as an issue.",4977
uniforms,ManagementBucket, Non-Management,1.64514550796,9.70550976871e-15,964,177,"First of all, I enjoy my job. Unfortunately, the pay is exceptionally low and the health benefits offered are under-whelming and very expensive for such a low paying job. My aunt called me to let me know that Taco Bell was hiring for 12.50 an hour and my daughter makes more working for Starbucks. I actually expected much more from Hilton. It is such a well known brand that I was sadly surprised. The travel benefits and the time off offered is really good!     Another area for critique would be the uniforms. When hired on, there weren't actually enough uniforms available to be assigned. The one shirt I did receive was of good quality, easy to wash and dry with a crisp presentable look. When I did receive the additional shirts, they actually need to be ironed daily to make them look presentable. Not sure why anyone would issue wool skirts as a uniform either. They are not user friendly, requiring drycleaning or at least a cold wash with a line dry. There is more upkeep required. The drycleaning offered by the hotel only goes out every few days and I have heard you may or may not get your items back in a timely matter. As I wear clean clothing on a daily basis, it would just be so much easier to receive a user friendly uniform or provide my own skirt or pants. I would also say I am surprised that I often see uniforms in all departments that are in need of repair or are in need of cleaning/pressing. In my experience, that first impression is so important. If we look good then people will immediately assume that we are good. if we don't meet there expectations as a first impression then it is a uphill push to convince them that everything that follows will be good!  Just a thought...    In my third area of observations... I really appreciate the lunch provided by the Hilton. I would say that the cafeteria often appears unclean, including the floors, tables, and at times the dinnerware. The food is at times tasty and other times it has been over cooked, has sat too long.","Cafeteria food has improved some but wish we had more fruits instead of the stale pastry. Less greasy and fried foods. Salad bar has gotten better. I like the Panini machine addition. But still could be better....  I really hate my uniform. Looks old-fashioned. Boxy shirt, flared, shiny pants. Doesn't make me feel proud to wear it.   Could we do something about the confined cubby holes that we call our work space? Feels so closed in and isolated even when you are working with other people in the office. Claustrophobic.","The one improvement I feel strongly about and would make a difference for both employees and guests are the uniforms. Not just my uniform at Bistro but all uniforms in the hotel. The uniforms are very outdated and look sloppy and unappealing, not clean and professional as one would want. I believe that black dress pants should be worn in every front of house department as that is the universal pant for professionalism and looks the most flattering on all body types and sexes. The khaki pants for Bistro that females are given are not at all professional looking and look like they are meant for males. It's uncomfortable to have a uniform that does not fit well because then the employee focuses on the fact that they look sloppy and are not presenting him or herself to the guest in the best way. I think employees should be allowed to purchase their own uniforms that adhere to the set standard because then that would allow for each individual to find what fits him or her best while still looking uniform.",1141

Ohana coffee: too much deep fried food. I know it tastes probably good but it kills us slowly too:) There are so many healthy alternatives witch tastes amazingly and easy to make as well. Our chefs need maybe a little training about healthy meals. For ex. grilled chicken/tofu instead of battered chicken or fish, sweet potatoes, coconut curries etc.  2. Grand Wailea food outlets: fresh fresh fresher food. I had a wrap at Bistro Molokini witch was not good at all, it was a veggie wrap and it did not feel fresh to me, like it was grilled maybe earlier in the day so the veggies were dry and flavorless.   Salads are very basic in a way that are easily made at home, for a luxury property we need some novelty, something we can get only at GW.","I like the food that it is serve for the employees but it could improve. there is times that the food is under cook like the chicken and such. sometimes the pasta that they serve is not cook right and its hard. also, there is particular supervisor that needs improvement in her attitude toward the retail associates. there had been times when she has said rude comments that are hurtful and non welcome. employees would rather not say their problems or ask for anything if she is the one in charge for the day. Her name is Jen Campbell. All the other supervisors are reliable and we can tell them if we have an issue.

There are a few employees here that seem to not being open to ideas or suggestion and a lot of times we don't have all the equipment or supplies we need to do our jobs. Also there needs to be an open communication about what the night crew is and isn't allow to do, due to the amount of noise that could and can be mad at night.

We need more equipment, glasses, silverware, etc.  F&B director and GM in my opinion seem to be shady, they talk about other employees to other employees, make some hourly employees report problems about other employees to them and seem to play favoritism with these employees.  I am new to the property and been in this business several years, they have not done this to me but I see the treatment and problems going on in the restaurant environment.

I mean in my department, housekeeping,  there are times I along with other staff members feel that  the boss doesn't recognize what all we need.  It came to the point where we had to bring it up in our Monday meetings to the general manager.  i feel that it's  this particular manager who should keep up with the supplies that we use day in and day out .. the supplies that we use for example the laundry bags soap conditioner every month we are struggling to make it look presentable to what guest think of as ""Hilton"" policy.  i personally feel disgusted having to put out mix match soap and shampoo supplies to the guest and no laundry bags. Simple things like that go along ways the ""Hilton""  brand.  same goes with cleaning  supplies.  we don't have adaqute supplies to carry threw the Hilton brand here.    the other topic, I like to put out is the laundry.   We need more machines, and staff in that department. just having one person do all that work .. it's  hard work , especially if one person does not like to fold  linen and comforters.. i recently have been put in the laundry dept for light duty and i  have noticed some things where its  a bit strange .. like why put one person in the laundry when they don't want to fold linen and  blankets and inserts. that just makes a lot of work for the person that  comes back the next day ..   same applies to housekeeping .. your can't do it half bottom you know. so i feel one more machines and one more person needs to be in the laundry room when it comes to things like this ..   last thing i want to bring up is the nepatisum in the staff members .. i don't feel it's right when a certain family member is the boss and you can get away with a lot of things - workload, scheduling.","I was an Over the road truck driver who decided to come home to do local work, all I can say this work in laundry is a challenge, but not so bad. I think that employees on the properties should be made aware to please not walk behind big box trucks or tractor trailers who are trying to back up..many times I have had golf carts with housekeepers on them dart in front of me and in behind the truck. This is very unsafe. I have caught people trying to operate the lift gate who is not authorized to do so. These kinds of issues when it comes to Commercial Motor Vehicles and safety should be addressed to all departments this includes Front Desk, Security, Housekeeping, Maintenance and so forth. I have seen very dangerous things occur while I did over the road work. My concern is not all people are aware of what the possibilities are when things go wrong with a truck.","The housekeeping assistant, (Jason) often gives orders that conflict with those of the hotel GM, making for confusing work days sometimes. He's fond of sitting in the office and not doing much to help unless he's pressed or asked to do so. Jackie from laundry is also allowed to slack off without much being done aside from management telling her over and over to stop to no avail. She gets more hours (overtime) than anyone because she stays late every day even though management is constantly saying ""no overtime"" which results in housekeepers getting three days off a week as opposed to the normal two.",2298

The remote Helpdesk team can often take weeks of frustration to solve an issue that deskside support was previously able to solve in minutes.

All of our productivity would be increased if Deskside support could have their ability to help us reinstated or if the quality and training issues with the Helpdesk could be remedied.","The workload itself can be overwhelming at times and our continued inability as a broader organization to break down silos and truly embrace a collaborative matrix environment adds unnecessary additional work to everyone's plates.

Those who are further down on the chain of command tend to have many demands coming at them from multiple senior leaders and it can be hard for them to say no.

That is what many other companies with similar situations - or companies too small to have an in-office gym - offer to their employees. Also, the Thrive program is great and promotes mental well being very well, but doesn't do much to really encourage and pave the way for physical well being. Please help find a way to include remote workers in the physical well being component of Thrive and the benefits that Hilton provides.

For the most part, I know what i need to select and it hasn't been an issue.  However, last year, I had to upgrade my insurance to a more costly insurance (silver to a Gold plan) due to some personal health issues I had to deal with at my doctor/specialists.  So, I selected the higher cost insurance to ensure I would be covered.  My only options to select from were Health Savings, Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum.  I have to compare between those programs which is fine.  However, after I selected an insurance provider under one of those plans... my insurance was not processed in a timely manner when I selected it during my enrollment period.  By January, I still didn't have my insurance card so I had to pay out of pocket in January and call the insurance.  Hilton and the provider realized the enrollment transmission for me did not go thru correctly so they re-processed it and it went thru.  By the time, I received my insurance card from the Gold plan that i selected said ""Managed Choice"" on the card.  I didn't choose Managed Choice.  Therefore, every doctor that I went too told me they didn't accept Managed Choice.  For the most part, I had to pay out of pocket while I was paying a higher cost in insurance out of my paycheck every time.  I have spoken to special service for this already.  My only suggestion for Benefits is to clarify if the health care provider is offering Managed Choice PPo Plan, Open Access PPO, etc.  I didn't choose Managed Choice.  But it was the only option I got.  That wasn't fair and its cost me out of pocket this year for no reason.      On another note, the office set up is poor.  Moving to this open setting in the office is very distracting, not very noise conducive, and lacks privacy and efficiency due to the set up.  I have feet traffic in 4 different directions where i sit at the office.  The noise alone is very frustrating cause I can't hear on my conference calls.","I would ask that the hotel continue to look for alternatives in health insurance companies for a PPO system since the rates for the employees have really gone up.

commuter,Topic_Improve, Benefits,16.400997322,1.38126211507e-06,14,489,"I believe that Hilton has a terrible commuter benefit considering the poor accessibility to the Mclean office using public transportation. The Hilton Mclean office is located 0.7 miles away from the Tysons Corner Metro Station. However this 0.7 miles represent an additional 15-20 minutes of commuting time either by bus or by foot. The current bus available (424) that takes you to the office is very unreliable since it is available every 10-15 minutes. If you miss the bus in the morning for a couple of minutes or if its late, it can add a significant amount of time to your commute, which is already long if you commute from DC. Additionally, there are no close crosswalks from the office to the bus stop to take the bus back to the metro station in the afternoon. Currently, team members jaywalk a 6-lane highway to be able to get to the bus stop, which is extremely dangerous. Also, the high temperatures during the summer or very cold and windy winter season make it very difficult and unpleasant for team members to walk from or to the McLean office from the metro. Nowadays, millennial employees, especially analyst or entry level employees,  do not want to purchase a car and prefer to use shared economy services so Hilton needs to be aware that the Mclean office location is not easily accessible if you don't own a car and should find ways to improve it.   Hilton should offer a shuttle bus to pick and drop of from the Tysons Corner metro station like several other offices within the area (e.g. Fannie Mae) considering how unfriendly Tysons Corner is for pedestrians. This shuttle service is already available for team members in the Watford office in the morning, lunch and afternoon so Hilton should consider replicating this service in McLean.","I strongly believe the following should be implemented as benefits for team members:    - Improved commuter program, which includes a stipend to be utilized towards transportation costs to/from work. The metro is incredibly expensive and can cost DC residents upwards of $10/day to ride; OR a shuttle that transports DC residents to/from inner city DC and the McLean office building. This would be cost-effective for Hilton to do and help DC residents to save money as well as efficiently work during our commute to/from work. A prime example of this is Google, which offers employees a shuttle to transport them from the office and into San Francisco. This has incentivized people to be able to live anywhere and still work effectively from the Google office in Silicon Valley, as well as helped employees meet each other through the shuttle commute. Additionally, we would all love to see a shuttle vehicle that can operate in the morning and evenings to provide transportation to/from McLean office and Tysons Corner metro station  - Potential partnership with WeWork  - Improved health/fitness program, which includes a stipend to be utilized towards health or fitness costs incurred throughout the month. This would align with the goals of the Thrive program and would provide a greater incentive to become physically active and healthier. I know that Thrive is meant to be inclusive of all team members; however, at some point there needs to be a separation and there could be benefits of equal value provided to other team members.  - Major changes to the internal promotion and compensation structure. With Hilton's current internal promotion structure, the company encourages team members to leave the company and then come back in order to receive the promotion and the compensation desired at a faster pace. Compensation is currently capped at certain percentages and values, which hinders one's ability to be promoted and receive a salary fairly","I suggest adding a shuttle system for Hilton team members who come into Tysons Corner metro stop.

In order to perform well and thrive, I need to be sure that a) my child is in a safe, accommodating environment while I am at work and b) other than the obvious motivational/developmental benefit of being at work, I also need to ensure I am not actually ""loosing money"" for dedicating my time at work vs. being a stay at home parent and currently that balance is still off, with ever rising childcare/supply costs.  Similar family-orientated and aspiring, futuristic companies put a variety of enhanced benefits in place, for instance @ HP -  an onsite nursery at corporate offices (paid monthly as part of the team members salary), @ IBM - a partner nursery/after-school care in which Hilton employees can receive special benefits and the list goes on.","While we have improved maternity leave benefits for new mothers (rightly so) we only offer statutory paternity leave for fathers.

The year before last, I had a Gold health plan. I chose to pay a lot more monthly because I couldn't afford to be hit with an expensive doctor's bill if I needed to go to the doctor. I chose the gold plan because of the co-pays, which made it $20 each time I needed to see the doctor. But I didn't realize the plan changed over the years and when I went to urgent care (which was a co-pay before), I was billed $250... just for a PA to look in my ears and prescribe me Sudafed.    I dropped my plan down last year (because I didn't see why I was paying so much for a plan that didn't even cover an urgent care visit... and there weren't any options where urgent care had a co-pay anymore) and had to get a new doctor because of the change. My ""establishing care"" visit alone was $340 out of pocket! Just to see the doctor to set up some routine prescriptions. Then my inhaler cost $55 for the ""cheapest"" generic albuterol. This is for a normal asthma inhaler that shouldn't cost more than $10.     What am I even paying a premium for??? I don't mind paying more monthly if it means I can avoid a big bill when I do see the doctor, but I've tried it both ways now and feel like I'm screwed either way. I pay so much each month for health insurance that I can't use, because I can't afford it. That's not right. Hilton needs to do better for their team members.     And please do not start offering plans where there is a charge for birth control again. Just because the president doesn't care about health care for low income women does not mean that Hilton should follow suit.",Health insurance is way too expensive.

loan,Topic_Improve, Benefits,12.3939354763,1.7836179795e-12,40,551,"The cost and availability of childcare is increasingly becoming a factor in whether a team member continues their career or not.  Increased flexibility in workspace and/or hours may retain many valuable team members who may otherwise resign. At this time female employees still bear the brunt of childcare, furthering likelihood of ""falling behind"" in their careers.  Finding ways to further assist team members in offsetting the costs associated with childcare would also be beneficial.    Along similar lines, students are continuing to graduate with debt.  Many companies are now offering loan repayment programs/assistance.  With the more recent trend of leaving one company after 1-3 years, rather than staying longer term, this benefit may aid in reducing turnover.  According to an article posted on SHRM: ""The foundation (Lumina Foundation) partnered on a recent study of health insurer Cigna's education reimbursement program that showed each dollar the company spent on tuition assistance generated an additional $1.29 in savings—a 129 percent return on investment—due to reduced turnover and lower hiring costs.""

Not to just listen, but communicate with them and take their ideas seriously.","The Sales department, specifically the senior sales staff and leadership, is a detriment to the ""one team"" atmosphere that is often spoken of. There is poor communication, very little urgency and a lack of ownership that frequently trickles down and puts undue stress and additional work on the Events/Catering teams, operations departments and does not go unnoticed by our customers.     There are constant excuses made for the senior sales team generally revolving around the 'stress' and 'pressure' they are under from corporate and upper management. This is dangerous language to use when dealing with a multi-level team, as it insinuates that their time is more valuable and their work is of more importance than others. It is common knowledge that several of the team do not know how to operate the systems that are used (such as Delphi), or know basic information about the product that they are selling. The current climate is that they are given carte blanche do what they need to do to ""get by"" and put rooms on the books, regardless of how sloppy the contracts are.  The expectation is that someone down the line is expected to clean it up. Given that the sales team is compensated better than operations, and bonuses off of contracts regardless of how they materialize, one would expect that they be held more accountable for their work.  They have been disappointing to work with, very difficult to communicate with and the quality of work that comes from their offices has been on the decline.

It's important for work/life balance with family. An example of this is the Fall Festival that was hosted on a Sunday.,"Roles and responsibilities aren't clearly defined in several areas which can lead to communications chaos. Many emails are sent just to add additional people on copy (because everyone needs to know..). This also spills over into excessive status update meetings where most participants don't need to attend, but just need to be informed of any decisions. Excessive meetings also fill up calendars, reducing the time available for innovation and other forward-thinking activities.","As great a company this is to work for, there are many moving parts.  The area I find most in need of consideration or improvement is the workload distribution within the RMCC.  Although all departments are valuable and well-meaning, the ability to add tasks to the calendar of the average Revenue Specialist should be a controlled function.  I have found it difficult to balance the staple functions of my role (call prep, calls, weekly forecast reviews and general admin) with the many additional initiatives and project roll puts coming from multiple different sources, seemingly at random.  with a full portfolio, I have two ""General Admin"" days on my calendar which I use to keep up with LTO participation, Rate season changes, LNR entry, HWU and any career development courses I am taking such as LIFT.  However, each week I loose 60 to 100 percent of that time to additional meetings or tasks assigned by enablement or added to RMCC-wide initiatives like Fantastic Fundamentals.  While I do see the overall goal in these initiatives and agree with them, I feel the managers need to be better utilized to manage/enforce these ideals and tasks so that we are free to regain our calendar with more autonomy.  I find that POD meetings are being used as an attempt to review all of the current tasks and initiatives, but cost additional time away from the performance of these tasks.  Said another way,  I spend an average of 5 hours per week in meetings covering tasks, initiatives or expectations which represents about 75 percent of the physical time I have available each week to perform the take-aways from those same meetings and initiatives.  I believe participation in many of these should be optional and determined by managers based on level of understanding, performance and need.  Managers should also be doing more to facilitate the side-by-side performance of the action items as well, ensuring the level of understanding is there so that the individual can attend fewer meetings.",40

insecurity,Topic_Improve, Company culture,69.4820583596,4.14643873634e-05,6,90,"We have seen many changes in our company culture; one of the newest being our new ""empowerment"" culture.  These changes were welcomed and needed in order for us to grow and compete in the market place.  The changes however seem to have created a sense of entitlement and an atmosphere of no accountability in certain roles. This sense of entitlement and no accountability has in some cases created no ownership for behaviors and actions that have the potential to or have negatively impacted our business, fellow team members, and our guest. The lack of ownership in turn makes it difficult to drive performance and move forward with new initiatives. I would like to see our senior leadership team do a better job of communicating that while we want to empower our team members we are also expecting our team members to act responsibly and perform in the best interest of our business, team members, and guest.     It has been observed that many team members feel insecure in there current positions and have at some point in the year felt at  risk of losing there current position and/or not having the chance to advance. I believe these feelings are stemming from some senior leaders verbally expressing that they do not believe existing leaders/team members are a ""good enough"" for advancement into another position and as a result have been hiring externally. Hilton is about building loyalty and growth; comments such as this creates insecurity and can be demotivating.  I would like to see our senior leadership more invested in their current leaders/team members; providing them with more personalized and focused development so they can successfully work toward advancement and have more opportunity for those advancement. For some this could mean the difference between staying with Hilton or choosing to vacate their position and/or leave Hilton.","One think that starts to scare me is how the ""In China for China"" strategy is being taken out of context. I totally understand why we have our own commercial services team for China and we need local team members to drive initiatives. This however is now being taken out of context and we have senior leaders from other functions that seems to promote a witch hunt for non local team members. I am myself getting more and more non local team member coming to me almost with a feeling of job insecurity because they are non local. To me, if we keep the ""In China for China"" on the commercial aspect then it is the right course but if we start creating a company culture in China that non local team member are not welcome, then we actually go against the Hilton value. I feel if we don't change the course of the direction in the past few month, especially driven by HR, Hilton will just become another local company and not a best place to work.    The other comment I would give is about non facing customer functions which seems to not realize they work for an hospitality company. Finance and HR are the great example of function which seems to really not understand that we are in the industry of serving other people and that it applies to everyone in the company, not only customer facing team members at hotel. As I said in my previous comment, this all comes down from senior leadership so it's about how these functions are being driven but when you have functions so reluctant to any change, not understand the millennial generation now in our company and overall not so willing to help others, we again go against our goal to become a great place to work.    Finally I think there is a huge need to Emotional Intelligence roll out within our company and up to senior leadership. It's really quite unbelievable how some leaders react, write email or just communicate with our team members. It comes from them still living in the 80s and not understand the greatest asset of a leader today is EQ.","There seems to be an entitled mindset amongst most team members.

I mentioned previously that we are going towards a world where the workforce is going to be a lot younger. Yes, experience is always going to be a key, but providing the experience to begin with is the first step. The concept of working your way up the ladder is next to non-existent in my department as a whole. There is zero movement in management and zero opportunity to even get there, or learn their positions. I return to the point about stagnating earlier. Yes, we need to cater to all guests, and sure, if it works, why change it, but in this day and age where everything is constantly changing, new things being released and updated every day, we can't afford to sit behind and be a chaser. Invest time in younger people, create the opportunities to put fresh ideas and concepts forward. Make a change and be a leader. Particularly in Sydney where so much development is happening around us, new hotels will compete for our market in the next 5 years, we need to stave them off and build loyalty now.

On days when we are understaffed, it feels as if you can not win.

Deskside support continues to be a joke. I know we are a hospitality company and not a technology company, but we must have systems that can handle our enterprise in order to facilitate being hospitable. Finally, Hilton seems to have lost it's way. We are throwing things against the wall and seeing what sticks, instead of careful planning and pointed goals. Multiple pilots or pricing structures happening simultaneously that conflict with each other is an example of this.

I legitimately want to be a GM by 27 of a small property but I don't feel like there's a possibility of that with Hilton unless my cards are so lucky to fall in just the right way.

There seem to be situations that I am not sure how people were placed in the roles they have. I know that this just sounds like a salty employee, but there have been many situations where people who are in leadership are asking their teams how to do things and/or situations in public where their true lack of knowledge is on clear display.  While I know that there will always be networks involved in any workplace, I feel like there are many undeserving promotions/hires based upon people having relationships outside of work, not knowledge and experience. Having experienced Hilton for many years now, I think that our organization as a whole has taken a fairly large step back in the quality of employees that we have due in large part to this very reason.      Also, many times new initiatives/ideas are half baked when rolled out and very little input was sought out by those who would be completing the tasks, when rolling out new items. These items often fail and much time was thus wasted while this could have been avoided had feedback been sought prior to release. I think that many times our ideas and thoughts are drowned out based upon a title that we hold and we must improve at communicating with all levels of employees and not just those whose title deems them worthy of contribution.    Lastly, please try and remove forced politics out the company. We must strive to remove all political agendas out of the workplace as there are lots of diverse thoughts and ideas within the organization. By pushing so hard towards one school of thought on social issues, we are alienating a large percentage of our company.  On multiple occasions I have been on conference calls with senior leadership only to have political agendas pushed. Please just remove politics out of the company culture and allow us to do our jobs and make Hilton bigger and better than it has ever been.","Less meetings and allow more time for creativity and implementation of new strategies/efforts.  Of the meetings we have, they need to ran more efficiently with less interruptions, side conversations, and late arrivals.  Working off of an agenda is helpful in keeping things on track.","Our general manager likes to micro-manage each department instead of trusting his department managers to lead their respective departments. He is so far removed from the day-to-day operations that affect each department and yet seems to make rash decisions without any input from those individuals who will be affected by such decisions. A good manager is just that - one who manages people and processes. A good manager trusts the people whom he hires and allows them to do their job without interfering. He should let each department manager lead and run their meetings - not try to push an agenda and take over as an outsider. In doing so, he alienates himself from the team. His patronizing behavior is inappropriate and offensive - he is not coaching a youth soccer team. He is managing a group of professionals many of whom are far more experienced, polished, and educated than he is. He should treat all employees with respect and dignity and in the same manner in which he treats department heads. It seems as if the general culture here is that we ""hope"" for success rather than plan for it. I have never seen an organization that spends as much time looking for excuses or someone to blame rather than looking for solutions. Our inventory and ordering processes need to be scrutinized and revamped. It is embarrassing to print folios on yellow paper because we have run out of white paper, or have access to only one or two printers because the other three are out of ink cartridges. Why is our housekeeping manager running to the local discount store to buy toilet paper for our guest rooms or driving 75 miles to the nearest DoubleTree property to pick up soap, shampoo, and body lotion?

I guess the recycling facilities hotel in the area the hotel is in can make a difference I stayed at the Hampton Inn Vancouver BC where there are recycling cans in the room even for food waste and then the Hilton Waikiki Village there is NO RECYCLING at all even for glass bottles! Even though the hotel was gorgeous (and I really appreciate the team member rate & the opportunity to stay there) that would really put me off staying there again Hawaii is too beautiful for garbage it made me feel like the hotel didn't care.,Maybe a handheld buffer(s) for cleaning stains off chairs and more gloves for picking up trash.,1162

While tenets support and encourage an inclusive culture, there seem to be separate segments or divisions occurring. An example of this change is from an initiative to hire from 3 diverse groups: external hires, college grads, and internal promotions. While this is an excellent strategy to diversify the talent and bring new ideas into the organization, there is a focus on developing the college hire group with less emphasis and attention given to talented individuals who are within Hilton, or to external hires, which is creating a rift among the junior leadership. I think that in order for this change to be effective and for our efforts to diversify culture to really have the effect we want, we need to be fair in providing opportunities all those who show potential, regardless of their ""group"". Something else that I have noticed is the development of a culture that is lacking trust, due to unclear or absent communication of direction/decisions. There has been a lot of change recently, at both the agent and management staff levels. These changes are not being communicated clearly, leaving everyone with a sense of uncertainty. This leads to people drawing conclusions and making assumptions, which only amplifies the lack of trust. There are also several competing initiatives, pulling us in different directions. I think that at a high level, there is a vision and direction, but somewhere along the way it is misinterpreted and actioned in different ways. This is the first year in my career here that I actually am concerned about an element of culture here. I still do believe that Hilton has a great culture and I am proud to have built a career here because of opportunities that were provided to me. I sincerely hope that this feedback is taken in the right way, and changes can be implemented so that our growth and change is inclusive, clear and communicated effectively.","While I appreciate the effort the company is making with the Thrive@Hilton program, on my end, it feels a little ridiculous. Thriving is great if you have enough bandwidth on your team to truly make it work. There are too many projects/initiatives and not enough FTE resources to handle the work load. And, when leaders/managers are emailing regularly outside of work hours and on weekends, it makes it challenging to disconnect. Perhaps Hilton could consider finding a way to completely ""turn-off"" email functionality outside of traditional working hours and especially during holidays or PTO days. I'm very impressed by Daimler's ""Mail on Holiday"" approach that allows employees to set their emails to be automatically deleted while out on personal time. The work still gets done, it encourages more staff collaborations, and allows employees to return to work actually recharged!","I would love to have more opportunities for career paths. The current org structure seems to only allow you to progress up on your team if your manager above you moves on or gets promoted. I would be very interested in being able to participate in a rotational type program that allows me as a mid-level leader to gain experience within different functions of the corporation.     Lastly, I would really like to see more initiatives to help create a truly innovative culture within the company. I often notice that peers and others leaders seem very fearful of failing, which I believe slows innovation. I would not say everyone has to just move fast, but we need everyone to move fast with a purpose to learn quickly and pivot when data/feedback from customers tells us a story. I would love if our company culture could turn into one that rewards individuals/teams that ""fail fast / learn quickly"" the same way individuals/teams are rewarded for doing safe successful projects.",2665

The climate is one that does not value tenured leadership (i.e. - those currently with 10+ years).  There is little to no interest or genuine appreciation in what these team members bring to the organization.  In fact, they are made to feel as though their ideas and contributions are not valid in today's business world as well as their days with the company are numbered.  There seems to be no future for those that fit into this category as there are no further development, growth or even hope for promotion opportunities.  There is absolutely nothing  being invested in the current leadership team (i.e. - training, further skills development, leadership development, mentorship, etc.).  All of this must be genuinely counteracted so that those who have spent their lives building the company's success can feel secure in continuing doing so.  Today's focus seems to be strictly on external hires, giving the feeling that tenured internals can only expect to hang on until your number is picked for you to exit the company.  There should be a much more balanced approach to continuing to build a strong/stronger leadership team.  The impression is that there is an underground strategy to phase out existing leadership and this is perceived all over the HRCC organization, all levels.  There seems to be extreme divisiveness throughout the organization in that senior leaders do not genuinely promote ""one team"".. they talk about about it, but they do not live that ""value"", which impacts the remaining work force.  There is a selfish undercurrent that exists where leadership behaves in a cut-throat fashion.  This can be seen at the very lowest level of the organization.  We've got great people in our organization.. senior leadership needs to find ways to genuinely make the HRCC culture and climate strong, positive and great again.  HRCC is missing the mark significantly today.","Our overall culture still does not support innovation and creativity.

The rank divide between VP & above VS the rest of the organization is still very prevalent, and this culture is reinforced through privileges that are given to VP+ though our travel policy, personal assistant, etc.     The lack of diversity in the VP+ leadership level (mostly white males) is also giving the impression of ""old boys club"" that is not palatable to many TMs.","One think that starts to scare me is how the ""In China for China"" strategy is being taken out of context. I totally understand why we have our own commercial services team for China and we need local team members to drive initiatives. This however is now being taken out of context and we have senior leaders from other functions that seems to promote a witch hunt for non local team members. I am myself getting more and more non local team member coming to me almost with a feeling of job insecurity because they are non local. To me, if we keep the ""In China for China"" on the commercial aspect then it is the right course but if we start creating a company culture in China that non local team member are not welcome, then we actually go against the Hilton value. I feel if we don't change the course of the direction in the past few month, especially driven by HR, Hilton will just become another local company and not a best place to work.    The other comment I would give is about non facing customer functions which seems to not realize they work for an hospitality company. Finance and HR are the great example of function which seems to really not understand that we are in the industry of serving other people and that it applies to everyone in the company, not only customer facing team members at hotel. As I said in my previous comment, this all comes down from senior leadership so it's about how these functions are being driven but when you have functions so reluctant to any change, not understand the millennial generation now in our company and overall not so willing to help others, we again go against our goal to become a great place to work.    Finally I think there is a huge need to Emotional Intelligence roll out within our company and up to senior leadership.

It just happens to be 4 weeks longer than the 6 weeks that is mandated by FMLA. 4 weeks makes no difference in a child that still needs their parent.   I also feel that Hilton should do more to help mothers in the building. I know Hilton does not own the entire building, but I cannot count the number of times I have seen women in the gym restroom pumping in a corner, trying to hide from other women coming in. Hilton should lead the way by either opening their pumping rooms to the whole building or making a building accessible one where mother's who do not work for Hilton can receive a badge for access. Mothers should have to resort to the corner of a bathroom to prepare food for their children.

I personally do not agree with the way the organization is divided under job titles. Analyst, Sr. Analyst, Mng, Sr Mngr, etc., puts people that are too young or not qualified in roles that should be more difficult to get. This contributes to the inefficiency and lack of advancement of initiatives I have seen across the board. It also promotes promotions based on tenure as opposed to accomplishments - it is why I have never liked working for a consultancy firm. It is a terrible model where people as young as 30 are managing others and that should not be the case. Also, a manager is a leader, it should not be mutually exclusive. If there was more space I would gladly provide more input in many other areas.",118

This is a direct link to our past and as it is also integrated into the new Vision Statement becomes a more meaningful message to our teams.   A direct strategy would be to share the speech on a #ThrowbackThursday, share the message in 4th quarter meetings about where the vision statement developed from, then re-edit the video to put Conrad's audio back, and make it a mandatory part of the Orientation package for all brands effective January 1, 2018.

Delphi,Topic_Improve, Computers/Technology/Software,103.740105909,1.98817178031e-28,36,1725,"Hilton is dated when it comes to deployment and technology.  Competition like Marriott has software that communicates to all of its hotels and has all the information you need on groups, accounts, contacts all in one web based application created by Oracle.  All of their Corporate Negotiated account information is also organized in online software.  RFP warehouse is so dated with the same generic information and clunky online system.  OnQ server crashes way too much and makes it difficult as a front line employee or someone on the phone with a guest.  We have way too many systems and databases that do not communicate with each other therefore experiencing skewed numbers and reporting.  For instance, OnQ and FMS can report different room night actuals therefore reporting wrong group actuals in sales databases like Delphi and SalesPro.  We should have 1 sales database (with restricted user access depending on your role and location), 1 reservations system that's merged with revenue management system so it can be viewed in real time, and they should both communicate.  Marriott also has account managers deployed nationally, local, regionally, etc and Hilton may have 1 manager deployed to 20 accounts and they range from all over a region or part of the country.  While that person is home based and trying to work that account from a surface level, there are multiple opportunities on various levels but the hotels are expected to fill that gap so multiple hotels are harassing the same meeting planners and local contacts therefore stressing out the same planner working one account.  Also take into consideration turnover, so now you have new managers calling on those contacts every time there's turnover.  Marriott has dedicated account managers in various levels that already have those relationships and can introduce the hotels without being too intrusive.  Also they can host exclusive client events on various levels. I would also suggest workstation refreshes like brand.","Please create a centralized data warehouse or data cube to house data from all systems. We spend a significant amount of time as a property pulling reports from various systems (RMS, FMS, R&I, Delphi, ResMax, PMS, Ops Audit, etc.) which then have to run through custom reporting tools created and supported by RM_Assist team (Daily Detail, Group Pickup, SRP Activity, etc.). While these tools are impressive in quality of build, they are often inflexible; focused on a specific output. By housing data from all systems in one location and allowing property-level analysts read-access, it would eliminate an entire layer or reporting processes. RM_Assist tools could be layered on top of the data source and only require a requery of data as opposed to a slew of macros to reformat reports from each system into a usable format - a significant use of effort and time. We could also develop dashboards for leadership at all levels, enabling on-demand access to useful information.

The EMV readers go very slow as well and it is not uncommon where the transaction gets stuck into pending.

With limited internet access it is quite hard to do a proper prospecting of new clients. Portable heaters would make winters more pleasant.,"Recently we have implemented EMV terminals (chip & signature/pin) to use for credit card (CC) transactions in all F&B outlets.      These terminals are stationary and although ensure the secure transmission of our guests personal credit card data, they significantly slow down the speed of service due to the following:  - Although the footsteps of our team members remain the same (traveling to a POS terminal to authorize CC transactions), the transmission time for these terminals to authorize a CC is significantly greater than the old method of swiping CC at the POS terminal).  - The EMV technology requires the use of pin numbers for debit cards and many international CC which further protects our guests.  However, the official SOP of the EMV terminals suggest manually entering any CC that requires a pin# (completely counter intuitive to the utilization of the EMV terminal).    The use of stationary EMV terminals within a Restaurant or Bar operation has caused some significant declines in speed of service which has a knock on effect on the operation and guest experience as whole.  I would strongly suggest the implementation of portable EMV devices with F&B outlets to process our guest's CC so that they may be present for the transaction (avoiding any mistrust in the lengthy process of authorizing a CC out of sight) and fulfill entering their pin# if necessary to further reinforce the protection of our guests personal information.    I would hope that the F&B outlet rollout of stationary EMV terminals is reconsidered soon, as opposed to being replaced when the currently installed machines become obsolete in 3-4 years.",8

The same people still get preferential treatment and get away with the proverbial ""murder."" This is my nth time answering this survey and I feel like I have to bring up the same issues every year. Everyone is expected to look sharp. That one person who looks sloppy everyday who is too important to even wear a suit jacket ruins it for everybody. It's bad…like really bad, because an oversized, wrinkled, and tattered cardigan is tolerated only for this particular team member. And hair that is not brushed and kept in a messy bun is perfectly ok.  And it's funny because some people get picked on for petty stuff that should not be an issue at all. This causes team members to hold grudges and be resentful towards leadership because they get randomly picked on and the repeat offender is not called out. Classic case of favoritism.  We used to have somebody in the team who was the obvious favorite, and terrorized everyone. But he was a favorite and he could not do any wrong. It is sad that the only way his employment was terminated was because law enforcement had to be involved for things he did outside of work. I know this has happened a while back but this has caused a lot of bitterness in the department because up until the very end, leadership was oblivious and tried to defend him. Address the real issues, while fun activities are great, they only mask the unaddressed issues. No – a seminar on workplace conflict is not the solution. Don't give people a hard time when scheduling dr appts, or question if alternative arrangements can be made.

HR needs to conduct a full investigation with every single manager and senior manager in Focus Service BPS as to how they are treated with full anonymity provided.    How Scott Schrank justified bringing back Nicole Reed after she verbally assaulted Isaac Lake at Hampton Conference in Orlando is beyond me.  She did this in front of not only her peers, but subordinates as well at the Crazy Squirrel Bar at the Doubletree.  Not only did Scott claim when he re-hired her that she was ""the best person for the job"" but she got a promotion to Senior Director.  Also, why are the only promotions around here the ones with pre-determined people?  Jenny Milos, Nicole Reed, Kim Smith, Amanda Brewer, and Sam Hargis all got promotions this year.  Oddly, NONE of their jobs with the higher status were ever posted on the job site.  These folks are the ones with an in, they are the favorites of Mike Obester and Nicole Reed.  They don't question the fact that the managers are treated like sub-human work animals, therefore, they got promotions.  Interestingly, Kevin Morgan and Ed Robison, who work harder than any of the 5 mentioned above did not get a title bump.  Is it because they actually treat their teams with respect, give them time to be flexible, and let them think on their own, coincidence, I think not!  Nicole verbally derides all of her subordinates if they even question something she poses.  Granted, if you ask her anything technical or thought provoking, she deflects using corporate buzz words to mask her gross ineptitude.  I was told 3 different times this year to apply for a job within a team by leadership and each time I was denied because I was ""not a right fit"", even though I had been encouraged to apply directly by the same leadership.

There are many opportunities to gain experience in different areas, but they do not seem to lead anywhere.  Recently HRCC posted and interviewed many people for DC positions and after 3 rounds of interviews told all applicants that they actually did not have the budget to hire DC's and told everyone sorry.  That was one of the most unprofessional, hurtful things this company has ever done.  They continue to use people at their lower hourly rate to do the jobs of DC's and others and that is just wrong.

When I did receive the additional shirts, they actually need to be ironed daily to make them look presentable. Not sure why anyone would issue wool skirts as a uniform either. They are not user friendly, requiring drycleaning or at least a cold wash with a line dry. There is more upkeep required. The drycleaning offered by the hotel only goes out every few days and I have heard you may or may not get your items back in a timely matter. As I wear clean clothing on a daily basis, it would just be so much easier to receive a user friendly uniform or provide my own skirt or pants. I would also say I am surprised that I often see uniforms in all departments that are in need of repair or are in need of cleaning/pressing. In my experience, that first impression is so important. If we look good then people will immediately assume that we are good. if we don't meet there expectations as a first impression then it is a uphill push to convince them that everything that follows will be good!  Just a thought...    In my third area of observations... I really appreciate the lunch provided by the Hilton.

I am constantly having to rush around the uniform room looking for any pants I can wear on shifts. a lot of the shirts also have huge holes in the arm pits and some days I have noticed people wearing black jeans fro home or no apron because there is such a shortage.  Quite often we are short on staff. we usually have to get people in from catering to cover busy shifts or cover sick days which makes it uncomfortable and stressful calling in sick because you feel like you don't want to let the team down.,"First of all, I enjoy my job. Unfortunately, the pay is exceptionally low and the health benefits offered are under-whelming and very expensive for such a low paying job. My aunt called me to let me know that Taco Bell was hiring for 12.50 an hour and my daughter makes more working for Starbucks. I actually expected much more from Hilton. It is such a well known brand that I was sadly surprised. The travel benefits and the time off offered is really good!     Another area for critique would be the uniforms. When hired on, there weren't actually enough uniforms available to be assigned. The one shirt I did receive was of good quality, easy to wash and dry with a crisp presentable look. When I did receive the additional shirts, they actually need to be ironed daily to make them look presentable. Not sure why anyone would issue wool skirts as a uniform either. They are not user friendly, requiring drycleaning or at least a cold wash with a line dry. There is more upkeep required. The drycleaning offered by the hotel only goes out every few days and I have heard you may or may not get your items back in a timely matter. As I wear clean clothing on a daily basis, it would just be so much easier to receive a user friendly uniform or provide my own skirt or pants. I would also say I am surprised that I often see uniforms in all departments that are in need of repair or are in need of cleaning/pressing. In my experience, that first impression is so important. If we look good then people will immediately assume that we are good. if we don't meet there expectations as a first impression then it is a uphill push to convince them that everything that follows will be good!  Just a thought...    In my third area of observations... I really appreciate the lunch provided by the Hilton. I would say that the cafeteria often appears unclean, including the floors, tables, and at times the dinnerware. The food is at times tasty and other times it has been over cooked, has sat too long.","Cafeteria food has improved some but wish we had more fruits instead of the stale pastry. Less greasy and fried foods. Salad bar has gotten better. I like the Panini machine addition. But still could be better....  I really hate my uniform. Looks old-fashioned. Boxy shirt, flared, shiny pants. Doesn't make me feel proud to wear it.   Could we do something about the confined cubby holes that we call our work space? Feels so closed in and isolated even when you are working with other people in the office. Claustrophobic.",324

When we have a little, or alot, of down time, many of these individual disapear and do absolutely nothing to prepare for future events. Our mangers need to be more critical of these action and find a way to be more watchful. We continue to have major amounts of ""time theft"". Believe me please. We could be more productive with our down time. We also need our mangers to be present when cleaning and organizing our pantry. Most of the people in our deparment don't know the first thing about organizing and need their hands held when it comes to this task.    Stewarding is still lacking in many respects. They need more hands on deck! They need more structure! They need better mangers. They need pull sheets from banquets that oultines, exactly, what we need on our sets. They need to use a sacle to weigh the silverware in order to make sure they are giving us the proper amounts. Our sets are constantly short on equiptment.    We need more Trash cans, with wheels, around the property with proper covers that are accesable to our guests.     We need a system that allows us to lock up our carts, and check them out as needed. Similar to checking out a radio. Whoever checks one out should be responsible for bringing it back clean and empty. We have major issues with carts that are left full of equiptment and that are, discustingly, dirty. We also have team members who hide them, or never bother to bring them back to the pantry. We need carts to do our job properly.","Lack of practical training for new team member, as the result, the burden or work load is delegated unfairly to other team member. Lack of recognition for some of the team member, sometime other team member did not get any food as no proper food for them. There is no clear job delegation between guest service role and food beverage department like delivering amenities which actually is GSA job role but it given to F&B department.

Its difficult to say Hilton is doing this as they outsource more and more jobs. Our off shore offices take twice as many calls, making our jobs insecure. There is no opportunity for advancement for part time work at home workers. There should be more flexibility in DC, mentoring, QA, fraud, and operations to work from home part time. Since more reservations jobs are being outsourced, perhaps US workers could be utilized as mentors, trainers, dcs and QA. Allowing us to keep our jobs, increase the reputation of Hilton domestically, and still satisfy stockholders need to shave expenses. Many of us have been here a long time, we love Hilton. But Hilton no longer is a hospitality company, it is an investment company. Little attention is paid to the errors created by our offshore offices. Little attention is paid to how much time US workers spend correcting those errors. If we were utilized in a training capacity, it could make our offshore offices more effective, increase job security and satisfaction of domestic workers. I also believe more and more is expected from reservationists (counselor approach) and we get no additional compensation. In fact, my commissions have been cut nearly in half for sales and HGV due to decrease in the number of calls I take due to taking long using counselor approach. I do not feel I am trusted by my manager or the company I work for. With the advent of mattersight and FPG, our every move is analyzed, compared and scrutinized. We are not trusted, we are nagged at every turn to sound like robots using a ridiculous script. When guests call us they want polite, accurate and fast service in that order. We don't need a script to be polite, and we don't need software to flag a call simply because we missed a word or phrase. No other position is scrutinized and has as much job detail as reservations, yet we make the least.",I think we as a company outsource too many things. Why pay too many other companies to do something when we have staff that are trained and fully capable to get the job done and done right.

He provides very obvious privileges to male (mainly white) staff members while restricting the rights of their black female counterparts. He doesn't posess the competencies necessary to complete the core functions of his job. I am 100% sure he doesn't know how to use Opentable, Unifocus, Agilysys or any other Hilton software at a server assistant level let alone at a manager level. He manipulates seating and section division to benefit certain staff members and works to negatively impact the earning potential of other staff members (those that provide feedback & challenge the status quo, & those that were simply born black and/or female). Still, no matter how many people bring concerns about Andrew & Sarah Grabinski to upper management of Human Resources, they are protected and retain their positions.

He doesn't care about his staff. He prioritizes his needs and his life over the success of the restaurant and the morale of his staff.   The Hilton needs to address the disparity in the restaurant in how staff are treated and hte evaluation of management. There is also no pathway for vertical or horizontal growth for employees. The Hilton's core values and annual goals are being presented as strategic successes in its annual report while at one of its newer properties, staff morale is low, opportunity is bleak, hospitality is a foreign concept, and employees are discriminated against and unable to successfully report the disparity up the chain because overall management wants to keep things secret.

He don't have knowledge about simple things for example how to put order through the micros or how to make a reports or do a cash up I think its so shame for a manager to don't know that.

I am not feeling comfortable to work with him for example when am dealing with complains and make it right he always getting involved and going after us to customers and make as looks on their eyes like we don't know what we are doing.

A manager shouldn't bring speculations and intrigue amongst employees. He would go to each individual and tell them that the other person has said this or that.

Sarah Burke is an awful FOM manager. She often just doesn't come into work claiming is something medical yet her AFOM tells everyone that she went out the night prior and is just hung over. As a manager she needs to lead by example and should have to follow the same attendance policy that agents should. She is always late. She freaks when she is under pressure and often takes out her anger on her agents. Our AFOM was found out to be sleeping with an agent for months and all Sarah could say was that she was happy for them even though employee morale was very low because of it due to the AFOM expressing blatant favoritism toward his now pregnant girlfriend. This agent went on to work at our sister DoubleTree property down the road and told people that Sarah told her to lie about her pregnancy. Sarah was fully aware of this situation due to the meeting about this agent that her and some supervisors had yet she acts like those never happened. Employee morale has been at an all time low due to Sarah and a couple good agents have left due to her. Sarah is also fond of sending accusatory emails to agents such as myself that Michelle (overnight manager) has to each and every time prove to her that she is wrongly accusing people. I'm not sure if this is because I took her to HR but it needs to stop. Sarah Burke is single handedly ruining this front office and not matter how many time she is taken to HR she hasn't change.

Often he has cut someone on the team off while they are speaking only to interrupt with wrong information. Multiple team members have observed him making sexist, racist, and xenophobic remarks, and it's obvious he doesn't respect everyone he works with. It's also obvious that no one listens to our feedback when we try to speak up about his conduct because many people in the department (past and present) are uncomfortable around him but anyone who says anything is treated like they're overreacting. The turnover on this team has been terrible, and one of the top reasons people leave is because of the manager. We're also frustrated because sometimes we don't get respect from other departments when we ask for their help to meet their requests, but our manager probably contributes the most to this impression of our team by not encouraging others to respect us. He also seems to have trouble remembering and understanding conversations, which is dangerous and scary when it's his word against ours.","I would improve management's professionalism in the workplace. Each day I arrive at work and am faced with constant sexist remarks that make it difficult to feel comfortable at my job. Remarks include subjects about sexual assault that are current news stories and how it is the woman's fault. As a woman, that is something that should never be discussed in the work environment. My sous chef says rude comments about the other women in the bakeshop and says demeaning comments about their appearance daily. Management makes fun of less ""popular"" employees in front of other employees and treat it as a joke. The constant bullying between coworkers and management makes it feel like an extremely unprofessional environment. In addition there are no room for movement to hiring positions, making it impossible to grow in my career path.","It's difficult for me to comprehend how so many people have quit and been fired over the past 1.5 years while my unqualified managers remain in their positions. Andrew Watts is sexist and often targets the black women on his staff. He provides very obvious privileges to male (mainly white) staff members while restricting the rights of their black female counterparts. He doesn't posess the competencies necessary to complete the core functions of his job. I am 100% sure he doesn't know how to use Opentable, Unifocus, Agilysys or any other Hilton software at a server assistant level let alone at a manager level. He manipulates seating and section division to benefit certain staff members and works to negatively impact the earning potential of other staff members (those that provide feedback & challenge the status quo, & those that were simply born black and/or female). Still, no matter how many people bring concerns about Andrew & Sarah Grabinski to upper management of Human Resources, they are protected and retain their positions. He consistanly allows for over and under staffing and disappears during his shift. He is hostile and reacts poorly under pressure. He is only satisfied when morale is low. He doesn't care about his staff. He prioritizes his needs and his life over the success of the restaurant and the morale of his staff.   The Hilton needs to address the disparity in the restaurant in how staff are treated and hte evaluation of management. There is also no pathway for vertical or horizontal growth for employees. The Hilton's core values and annual goals are being presented as strategic successes in its annual report while at one of its newer properties, staff morale is low, opportunity is bleak, hospitality is a foreign concept, and employees are discriminated against and unable to successfully report the disparity up the chain because overall management wants to keep things secret. The only way to improve things is to address the issues with management & HR",75
immature,Topic_Improve, My Manager,29.6739519885,4.97364845444e-06,11,5,"Management in my department tends to act very petty and childish at times. I do have a good sense of humor, but when your managers go out of their way to speak ill of an employee who is transferring to another property in front of other employees, it's hard to take them seriously as managers after that. One of my managers called down people from another department just to let them know how she did her  best to make the former employee's life as hard as possible on their last few days. They hadn't even had any problems with this employee, they were just acting immature because this employee was leaving. The things my managers say about them always being supportive of us taking other job opportunities is a complete lie, and something that they have to say just because someone from HR is standing right there. Overall they are not bad managers, and relatively approachable as people but things like this really hinders my respect level for them.",the managers need improvement. so unorganized. very immature. etc..,"Annual salary increases.

degrading,Topic_Improve, My Manager,27.6956885226,7.07917960195e-07,14,17,"Our Manager Megan Brennan lacks doing our schedule correctly. After how many years, you would think she would know how to do it correctly and abide by the union rules. Instead she likes to give her favorite workers (casuals), the shifts that FT team members or leads should have. She has been known to force people to stay late or ask people to stay late(and pay overtime) so she can get her favorite TM's off early to go have drinks and dinner. Shes been caught talking bad about fellow TM's to other TM's. She continuously talks down to and makes people feel bad about even using the restroom and doing so in front of customers. We call to see if someone can relieve us to go to the bathroom, but they don't answer, so we go and then she degrades grown women. She obviously doesn't have kids and doesn't know what a weak bladder feels like. Guests have even apologized to me for the way she's talked to me during her rants in front of them. Its embarrassing and humiliating. She has even put down a fellow employee about her clothes not fitting right because of her pregnancy. She just doesn't have leadership or people skills and she needs to be replaced. Also, she makes the 12:30-8:30 shift take our breaks before 2, so we starve all night instead of giving us a dinner. I know her or Melissa wouldn't make each other starve that long. That's not right. Hilton is supposed to take care of its employees. We need a new manager ASAP. Our Dept. has a high turnaround rate and upper management has to be asking themselves why that is I hope. These roundtables are not working. It was just to protect them before the survey. Nothing is getting done or fixed.","My main concern currently is regarding my immediate manager, Bonnie Goodwin, the guest experience manager (GEM). Attempting to speak with the gem regarding vips or even suggesting a more effective method for a task is nearly futile. She seems to take any sort of constructive criticism personally, which is obviously not a professional response. The most serious issue, however, is the lack of trust she has from her team. I do not see her capable of leading our team or bringing out the best aspects of each employee. I also do not feel that she would support me in any way. She has a habit of ""forwarding tasks along"", which is not only confusing to guests but shows she is either lazy or simply cannot follow through with a task. She displays a serious lack of leadership skills, which is palpable in her handling of everyday team member issues. Receiving 10 emails in one day saying only ""phone is ringing and ringing"" not only shows lack of trust in her team, but shows that she saw the phone ringing and chose not to answer it. We are responsible adults and if the phone was not answered there is likely a good reason why. Her lack of luxury, operational, and, embarrassingly, grammatical knowledge is not only obvious, but detrimental to our growth as a team. This lack of knowledge could be passable if she demonstrated any example of trying to educate herself in luxury standards, however this is not the case. Being relatively new to the hospitality industry, I look to my leaders for encouragement and advise on how to improve myself. Since I have been in this position, my training has been extremely limited and unorganized. Instead of continually advancing, my last training session was ""Phone Etiquette"", which was, quite literally, how to answer phones. As someone who possesses a Bachelor's degree, this is almost degrading. I am told she has a vision for our team, but what that is I cannot say, and if asked how she was hired as a VIP manager at a luxury resort, I would not know.","I think that there is a severe divide between AM and PM shifts in regards to fair treatment, accountability and exposure after wrong doing. The AM shift as a whole has the impression it is not cared about as much as PM shift. AM is always put on blast in emails but if AM goes to management about a problem left by PM it is swept under the rug. There is obvious favoritism towards certain people. There is no team unison at all. Managers are not only manager of one shift but the whole restaurant from breakfast, lunch and dinner but it does not feel like that is an important concept.   All J1s are not properly trained and are just thrown into stations and when they do something wrong they are scolded or looked down upon. There is no real teaching system going on for them, they are here on an internship and are supposed to be taught. I have heard them be talked to in ways that are degrading and rude. To improve I think time truly needs to be taken to train and teach them and there needs to be more patience and respect for them as students and cooks. Not one of them has been sat down and asked what they have learned or what they want to learn or what station they want to work on or try. When new management started not one employee was sat down with one on one to ask what we needed or wanted out of our careers or job place. I don't feel some of our opinions are valued at all or even listened to.   I think there is a problem with positive reinforcement here as well as certain peoples abilities to positively react to feedback. There is always a sense of retaliation  after feedback on anything is given. When going to management about concerns it doesn't feel like it is taken seriously or cared about. There is no care about career growth here by management for employees. Communication is terrible, it is either nonexistent or can be passive aggressive.   Employees are made to park in an unsafe parking lot during winter snow storms with an unsafe shuttle system.",31

Melissa,Topic_Improve, My Manager,20.771766392,2.47050815783e-06,17,135,"I suggest that the retail management team (Melissa Trinidad and Megan Brennan) should be audited. Our department morale has been way down and we cant seem to keep our employees. Our department doesn't meet goals and the main suggestion they have in our department is to be luxurious. Our department is the lowest paying department in the hotel and our managers don't encourage us or push us to feel good about working in the retail department.   Melissa Trinidad and Megan Brennan have every excuse in the book as to why nothing is their fault and can't do the basic of duties such as work a register, give employees pee breaks, check on employees and altogether  being supportive leaders. Our managers are hard to find they always say to call them but they never answer their phones but all you have to do is call Pink Lilia (a shop in the hotel) and Melissa will be there hanging out with our team lead.  Melissa Trinidad is a lazy leader and does the bare minimum just to get her by and then talks her way out of any issues that may occur and blames our supervisors and team leads for them not doing her job. Melissa and Megan have numerous complaints against them and have been in HR with numerous employees for numerous different reasons and HR still chooses to belittle the associates with complaints. The ""if you're unhappy hear then quit.""  saying is not a solution but a problem that makes employees feel that Hilton doesn't care for their employees and less of the heart they claim us to be. I think communication and job accountability can be improved. I honestly didn't come with intention of complaining about my manager but that is the biggest problem I have with this hotel. We have done numerous amount of surveys and no change if any thing it made everything worse. I used to love coming into work. I love what I do but hate the pay and knowing this is my leader and I have to follow their lead is depressing.","The main thing that concerns my coworkers & I in the Retail department are the two main managers, Melissa Trinidad and Megan Brennan.  It's really hard to contact them when we need help. Especially when they are not in their office, they don't tell anyone where they go. Not only that calling them multiple times doesn't help as well. They do provide their persona; phones for us to call, but they still don't answer. It's sad as well because we can't even rely on them for anything, the leads are more helpful than they are. Our leads are willing to listen to our concerns and they do speak up for us when needed. Our department managers are also hard to talk to because they always reply with a sarcastic comment or reply with attitude. They don't respond to criticism very well. They will take it personal and somehow take it out by affecting schedules/hours. They also display unprofessionalism for example, correcting a team member in front of another team member. Not only that I feel that as managers they should be able to answer questions & concerns that we have. Yet, they always respond with I don't know or I'm not sure. As a team member that's very disappointing because we all depend on them for guidance, yet they can't provide that for us. Even the new team members who haven't been here for a month yet, see how unreliable they are. Speaking for my whole department we deserve to be treated with respect from our managers. OR just replace them would be a very much appreciated favor. Thank you!","I have never interacted with Melissa outside of the time period where we needed to talk about the team member survey results, so I can't truly say whether or not she is fulfilling her role responsibilities. Megan interacts with all of my fellow retail department coworkers. Megan regularly chooses to schedule in a very inconvenient way. Megan also makes jokes at very inappropriate times. She made a joke about my anxiety when I had a health incident. I do not talk to anybody about my life outside of work, as a result of that incident. I do not feel welcome enough in this group of people to do so. I recommend she stop making jokes at other team members expense.      Some other suggestions would be; more vegan options in the cafeteria, schedules that are not six days, don't schedule so people work up to 8 days in a row, and if everybody could communicate directly to who bothers them without fear of retribution that would improve morale dramatically. I have worked 8,7, and 6 days in a row, and that is not conducive to the most effective and efficient group of workers, when they are exhausted.

Alex does not trust team members, he listens behind closed doors to hear private conversations, he has said before that he knows and hears all that happens. if he does not like what you say he accuses you of lying the only correct opinion in this dept is his no one elses. The drop in gratuity on vouchers is demoralizing, we are not getting 18% as the voucher states. These uncalled/unscheduled post shift meetings need to stop. Meetings need to be properly scheduled in advance on the schedule, not called at last minute. Two weeks schedule needs to be done per Hilton policy, not a FAKE or DRAFT schedule as Alex makes. This does not allow for planning, Schedule needs to be posted at noon Wednesday as Hilton policy states. If we are bound by Hilton policy then Alex should be also. The stress put on the staff by Alex is enormous, there is no appreciation for what you do, just a constant demand to do more, Some of the demands are unreasonable and he should be able to see this. We can not be everywhere at once yet if you are not, then you are not satisfying guests, and don't try to defend yourself because there are no acceptable reasons.","We have recently obtained a new leader. It's been months and I still have an uneasy feeling everyday coming to work. I have worked for Hilton for a long time and I can honestly say this is the first time Ive ever questioned my own job security, and not for reasons of reflection of my own work. I have always dedicated so much time and energy to this company as it has always dedicated the same into me and my growth. I am not lazy. I do my job and then some. I'm willing to pick up addtl duties to help my team, no questions asked, no addtl compensation expected, really nothing addtl expected however it would be nice to feel appreciated and recognized for the addtl duties above and beyond my job I do. I instead felt pressure from my Manager that I wasn't living up to her expectations of completing my own tasks while I was doing the workload of 2 employees. When a person is put under the pressure of that much of a work load, and is working 14-16 hours a day, sometimes 6 days a wk, there are bound to be some human errors. To not feel appreciated for stepping up to help out your team, but have your Manager talk down to you if a mistake is made, and make you feel like you simply aren't doing your job is VERY discouraging (when youre doing 2 jobs ). My Manager has told me once in a 1 on 1 meeting that I was doing a good job. It was nice to hear and thats all i needed to feel justified for throwing away my personal life to do this. Within that same week, she questioned how I spent my time, why I let a mistake happen, and asked why I didn't complete a task that I had already told her I wasn't capable of completing simply from a time juggling perspective. Its like she didn't hear me. Shes asks how she can support me, but then there is no follow through which feels like a slap in the face. Id almost prefer she didnt ask me at all. I feel like my goals for next year will be what she hopes for rather than realistic & obtainable and that scares me. I feel as though ill be pushed out",14

Since the moment he comes in the morning, for pre-shift, he begins to complain, getting everyone in a bad mood. This is my subjective opinion, but speaking facts, a manager shouldn't be allowed to discuss other employees, their personal issues, as to why someone was let go, or why they quit. A manager shouldn't bring speculations and intrigue amongst employees. He would go to each individual and tell them that the other person has said this or that. When we are lacking supplies, or we were not informed about the level of business, he will blame on the upper management. He will have less staff when we're busy, or too many servers on the floor, when there is not business.   We are always out of napkins, coffee cups, we need to personally go and ask the dishwashers for clean silverware. We run out of champagne on Sundays (one of the busiest day).

The Banquets department HAS NO CONTROL of it's associates we are spoiled rotten with minimal side work duties and high compensation yet we provide the most awful, un-attentive service in San Diego all while charging some of the most expensive rates I have ever seen in Hospitality. The banquet department employees are greedy, un-friendly, abusive and because they have ""seniority"" over you they take advantage and gather up numbers and go to the union and file grievances and complain about everything. I am so confused at times, what happened to providing authentic hospitality? What happened to thinking about the guest first and our needs last?

Un-fortunately It doesn't end there. The whole schedule system of the department is a complete mystery.

This is not Healthy anymore.,"We need a new assistant front office manager, John Aquino is not a good influence to the department, he is abusive, boastful, unfair and disrespectful. he doesn't care about his people. he even shout to one of my colleague in front of a guest in the lobby to humiliate him in front of the guest. and during one of our briefing he swears on one of my colleague and throw him all papers in his desks to humiliate him in front of my colleagues, he is abusive verbally and physically. one of my colleague who has a heart disease immediately resigned because of John Bensen Aquino's words and abusiveness. and in our department they should improve their skills in handling their employees, specifically in giving the right amount of breaks, and about giving schedule because they do not care about the health and wellness of their employees. the managers don't motivate their people specially John Benses Aquino, he will make you feel that you are nothing, he will shout in his people everyday just to make everyone humiliated. he even harasses female employees verbally and physically. I think Aquino being the assistant front office manager is a very bad thing. he is a very bad influence to the front office people, concierge, guest relations and even bellmen. the department will not improve if he is still there. he asks his people to do hard stuff that is outside their job description like he asks one of the concierge to clean the fence in front of the drop-off area alone just to humiliate him . I think his attitude and personality doesn't belong to Hilton, it is too much and I think that is not the way of Hilton. this place should be a challenging, motivating, fun and inspiring place to work.",156

This is because an agent may receive a low score, even if they did nothing wrong, simply because the guest weas unsatisfied with the overall experience, hotel response, and not necessarily our personal response to them. Additionally, we may receive a low score because we did not give the guest what they requested even though we followed procedures that we were supposed to. For instance, a guest has an AP stay and wants to cancel. They do not qualify for an exception or a change fee due to the listed dates of arrival. I respond back with the terms and conditions, no refund, and apology. The guest gives me a low score because I denied their refund. I suffer because I did my job. Make sense? I just don't think that there is a fair way to count these scores in conjunction with agent performance unless someone is going to personally go through each low score to verify that it is legitimate based on the situation. I also think that QA processes should be updated so that we are not always counted off for not using a template in non voice. There are certain question's that there are no templates for. For instance, I received an email asking if we are affiliated with the NFL. I look it up, we are not, and there is no template that would make sense in a response to this guest for this inquiry.

The above property structures have become very expensive and we have become slow. There is certainly not a culture that suggests that these supporting functions exist to help the hotels thrive. We have carved out competitive disadvantages!,"I understand the need for the voice of the customer survey to gauge customer satisfaction but it also needs to be fair to the agents who are doing a balancing act on most calls to try to satisfy our members while still keeping within Hilton guidelines. I feel like we should be able to contest surveys cause sometimes we are scored low because we could not change a name on an account on the spot or we cannot change a current room rate to a lower rate they saw yesterday. Also, members can make mistakes in keying in the numbers for the survey where they are clearly satisfied on the comments but the score does not reflect that sentiment. It is  not fair that agents suffer from these things.   I think we should have a clear goal, a set score to aim for, not this desk average system where even if you are performing higher than the desk your percentile is still not good enough. On every criteria we have for CTE we have a clear set goal like for attendance and availability. We should align it with this just like how it was before. We are not in competition with one another. We are here to deliver the best possible customer experience possible. We should not have to worry about how we compare with other agents. We just need to focus on being hospitable and delivering the best possible customer service experience.  This leads me to the scoring 1-5 on customer service, if 2-4 is failing we should not even have that option. It gives the notion to members that 4 is still good, 80% where in reality it is not. It just needs to be straightforward. If we keep the 1-5 scale then all scores should be taken into account.  Customer Care department is a mixture of agents with different skill set. Most are not reservations trained while some are.The agents who are skilled in both are at a disadvantage because they have the potential of getting scored for reservations outside their control like MLOS or rate change or cancellation fee while non reservation agents have the luxury to transfer.",12

Given when the deadlines fall, there is always a sense of playing catch up, particularly when setting the initial objectives part way through the year. Although the setting of objectives has become more of a collaborative process, the majority of objectives are cascaded from leadership, leaving limited scope for personalising. Moving forward, it would be good to see the PRP brought forward in the year to January/February and similarly the compensation awards too. This will ensure there is more of the year to focus on achieving new objectives rather than continuing to reflect on the year just gone. Within the objectives, it would be great to see more of an even split between company/department goals and personal objectives, with proportionate weightings.","I would like to see some improvements made to SuccessFactors or the review process in general.  Every year we get the same dialogue about how ""Meets Expectations"" is a high standard.  I think it's ridiculous that there are two options above that then.  I don't feel it encourages people to go above and beyond unless it's just in their work ethic to do so.  We're also told that it should be ""impossible"" to exceed expectations or be exceptional.  if it is impossible, then just remove the options and make the grading system more pass / fail like the Competency for Living the Values, which is either Meets Expectations or Does Not Meet Expectation.     Similarly setting objectives seems like a joke.  Some teams use it, others don't.  The goal that is actually set follows the same prescription as the competencies in regards to being ""impossible"" to go above and beyond.  I completely understand the SMART goals methodology but don't feel it always works.  I believe my supervisor directly told me that ""compared to my counterparts, I was not doing as much as them"" which is why I couldn't be scored as high even though it seems irrelevant to hitting personal goals.  I don't understand why we would pit people against each other for a rating.  To compare work to school, seems to me everyone should be able to achieve an A in class.      In IT we are involved with so many tasks (OPEX, CAPEX, Operations, project management, etc) that fitting in objectives can often be an after thought.  If we tailor our objectives to what we feel we are naturally doing anyway, then what's the point?  I hope HR has looked at some potential replacements for SuccessFactors and we might see a new solution in the near future.","Performance Appraisal System-while overall it's a fairly good system, I tend to see people become ""chained"" to their CDP objectives. TM's may be missing opportunities for true development because they have certain ""objectives"" outlined for financial gain (even if they aren't still relevant sometimes). Is it possible to remedy this by adding a ""flex"" goal? For example, a TM participated/planned/had success in a specific project and/or initiative that wasn't necessarily a planned objective, but had an impact with measure results. This could be a way to highlight the ""go-getters"" who work ""outside of the box and objective lines."" This will be a way to formally to showcase those efforts.",2332

I've worked for plenty of Directors of F&B but he only seems to point out all the negative aspects of the restaurant/employees. Only taking pictures and threatening write ups instead of communicating with us what we can improve- as a team. No hospitality whatsoever. Im sure he doesn't know my name and walks past me with no acknowledgement but only says good morning when you're not doing your job to implement fear almost. I wish this was an opinion but the facts are in the cameras everyday. Every Director ive worked for shows compassion, sincerity, respect, and motivates us to be better every day. Knowing our names and asking how were doing as a person,- basic hospitality- is crucially important especially for Part-Timers. Give us a reason to stay. Show us what kind of employee to be for this hotel. There are many different jobs and hotels great benefits out there, why should we work for you? I know it can be difficult since there are hundreds of employees in F&B but its the effort to actually try and get to know us and tell us how great we are/what we can improve on is what makes the workplace more enjoyable and have us employees take pride in what we do and who we do it for. Be the example you expect from us everyday. He asks for so much but gives us so little. We've discussed getting our own chairs so there's no more confusion about floor boards and write ups, new uniforms were promised to the hostesses and outdoor uniforms for the servers since the weather outside in unbearable hot,  even the girls' hostess stand hasn't been fixed/replaced and its been over two months since removed . Not ONCE have we heard any updates on any of these matters. Our voices clearly don't matter and I feel like Director of F&B needs retraining on hospitality and being a LEADER not just a boss.","It is my view that some Supervisors/Duty Managers need to adopt the Hilton ethic of One Team, One Culture and learn some humility. Very often I am faced with non-smiling and non-recognition from these people where a simple hello/goodnight etc., should be the minimum expectation. These people should lead by example, but instead give off the air of being superior. This does not garner respect but creates a divide, it costs nothing and should be encouraged, whether co-workers are from the same department or not.","Managing up, humility, intrapreneurship, shifting mindset, transforming the role of the call center, dedicating time and resources to improve and enhance the productivity of our work to result in mutually beneficial relationships - across Hilton, our customers and our agents(team members).     I love serving others, and am constantly thinking outside of the box - and I would love to apply the insights and wisdom I have gathered into the development coach role, and across Hilton as a whole. Initially I assumed this was the goal of the college hire program in the DC role, yet the demands of the DC responsibilities have inhibited such innovative thinking and creativity. I can certainly see the fruit of the old ways and the patterns that produced it still lingering in the midst of transformation to align company values and infuse them across assets and team members. I strive to make wise decisions, that consider the context of the big picture, making it extremely difficult for me to pick up my feet and be swept by the strong current of short-term responses, reactions and thinking.     Again, there is huge potential here, at Hilton, HRCC and on the ResSales Desk. I am excited to see the plans God has for every single part of Hilton.

They do not ultimately care about the performance of the business as a whole, just about the maintenance of perceptions outside their department that everything is okay even when it isn't. Accountability for decision making is poorly lacking- bad decisions are made all the time and just dictated to the staff to take on. Cannot remember a single instance of senior leadership putting up their individual (not collective) hands and apologising to team members for poor decisions made that affects their teams. Senior leaders engage in favouritism. They protect their own. They isolate and alienate anyone seemingly challenging their views or ideas. Senior leaders give lip service to Corporate values perhaps once a year or whenever there is a HR push to circulate this around the teams. In reality Senior Leaders have their own set of values- this involves a culture of self-serving, of risk-management from a personal level i.e. eliminating anything or anyone that threatens their credibility, favouritism, short-termism in decision making, outsourcing technical projects at significant cost to external consultants. Senior leaders also are racist and ageist. They vast majority of promotions in Finance are of white race and aged 25-30. Anyone not fitting that criteria is too diverse and is overlooked for promotion no matter what their individual high performance review say. This whole section of suggesting improvement is academic, as I have found in my experience that suggesting improvements to management often if not always falls on deaf ears. The messenger will be shot. If the message does not 'fit'- the senior leaders do not want to hear it. Cannot stress strongly enough the inability of senior leaders to take corrective action if one of their prior decisions is a poor one. Decisions also tend to be made by Senior leaders under consensus thereby absolving themselves of personal responsibility known as 'risky shift'. Times up.",1470

Diversity is not reflected in our executive committee. Until recently, it seemed as though VP promotions were more men than women. Also, there is an evident lack of racial diversity for Latinx, Black, and Asian cultures. We are here in the organization, it would be nice to see senior leaders who look like us.     A different improvement I recommend is a work-travel program where TMs get to visit the different corporate offices. More often than not, international travel to our other offices is limited to Directors who have direct reports, but all TMs could learn from visiting our other offices and experiencing the culture there. I think we have the great ability to offer international travel to any TM who would want it - we have worldwide hotels and global offices. I think this could cultivate a new wave of leaders who understand the cultural nuances from office-to-office/region-to-region and allow us to excel as a globally responsible company who treats all cultures fairly.","Our team members in corporate feel many of our leaders, VP's, SVP's lack any type of humility.  When we consider promotions, this should not be just about how well someone manages up but most importantly how they treat others at more junior levels.  We need a more robust process when it comes to promotion.  i.e. not just one other more senior person from a different function providing input for a particular promotion but multiple team members at lower levels providing feedback also.","There is a lack of real leadership in the focused service department. Some leaders do not listen to feedback, and will often take employees work and repackage it as their own. Give people credit for the work they do.   One Senior Director regularly uses fear and intimidation to manage her team. And despite being universally disliked, was inexplicably brought back after a three month move to a competitor. These behaviors need to be addressed.  Our VP has no concept of what is actually going on in the day to day lives and work of the people in this department. And, though I think he actually does care, he allows himself to be managed by his direct reports and only listens to what they say is going on. We need leaders who lead and welcome feedback in the focused service department.   Our collaborative space is an opportunity- You can't hear yourself think with people talking all around you. Endorse and encourage Thrive instead of threatening people who try to use it.   Create real opportunities for advancement in the department. Not lip service promotions to a chosen few with no transparency in the process.     I have at any given time anywhere from 9-11 people who could be giving me work to do. And each of them feel that their initiative or task should be top priority. We need to be focused first on serving our customers, not a confusing hierarchy of internal partners  The bonus compensation: when hired, I was led to believe that the range was 12-18%. In spite of regularly receiving ""exceeds"" on my year end review, I have never received higher than 12.5% bonus.   Documenting that we have done something is more important than doing it. focus on the hotels and owners. not SalesForce  The department discourages innovation- and when a new idea is proposed certain leaders act quickly as if it were their idea, and take credit for it, by misleading their leaders.  in the long run this has hurt us by focusing on the wrong improvements.

A different improvement I recommend is a work-travel program where TMs get to visit the different corporate offices. More often than not, international travel to our other offices is limited to Directors who have direct reports, but all TMs could learn from visiting our other offices and experiencing the culture there. I think we have the great ability to offer international travel to any TM who would want it - we have worldwide hotels and global offices.

The reason is that it seems like a defensive environment in which they're all wanting to point fingers at another, or hire a new Chief of something to take on the responsibilities they do not want.  In short, it feels like none of the leaders want to make any decisions and certainly don't want to take any risks and stand behind those risks.  It feels like we have many scared leaders just trying to protect themselves.  It's sad...we can't get much done because decisions simply are not made.  What happened to the days when our senior leaders actually seemed to live out the Hilton values and seemed proud to work here and excited for each opportunity that came their way?  Now it just feels like politics and constant defense.  I have never felt less informed either and it seems like there are ""secret meetings"" happening at high levels and trickling down to my level and it makes for such a poor work environment and bad morale.  Like we cannot just inform each other what's going on but rather hallway discussions seem to derail official meetings and I don't understand it.  Why can't we just work together, be honest about what is going on, and look for solutions together?  I keep hearing that topics are ""very political and we have to approach them in a sensitive way"".  I am not a politician and I hate that our current leadership is causing so many to become one.  Let's just be transparent and try to make good decisions.  Just seems like everyone is so out for themselves that they don't want to entertain any risks in any way.

I hear top managers bad mouth certain groups if the group is not to their liking.  The market segment that seems to get the most negative attitude is the hobby market.I know that market has a large portion of the sales goals so I am not sure why we don't treat it better.  If the managers have a bad attitude towards it, that will trickle down to how the supervisors and line employees treat the groups.  I also have a question on the ""I"" in Hilton.  I thought it stands for integrity.  But when we start to break or dishonor portions of signed contracts with groups so that we can accommodate other groups and we use the phrase business decision to do so, I'm not sure where the integrity comes into it.  I am talking signed contracts.  If a group came to us and asked to break their contract because they had made a business decision, we would not be happy.  But it's okay if we do it?

It is very difficult to try and work up within the company and asking for training is like having a chat with the sidewalk.  To be quite frank, I don't see the point of these surveys.

Having phone duty just makes our work load push back from answering guest complaints/inquiries. This should only be done by two or three people. If there's not enough then hire at least one more person to mandate this. It is unfair for us that our workload gets push behind while the main person who is answering the phones gets helped.

The communication with some DC's feels like a constant scolding of how CNV/ ADR numbers are not high enough. The stress from upselling customers on every single call is exhausting and can drive one to thoroughly dislike their job. While I LOVE customer service, and truly thrive in assisting others, the ever pressing demand of ""sales goals"" is an emotional strain. All of this on top of ending every call with an HGV transfer feels like harassment for agents and the guests.","Team members are frowned upon when ADR/CNV are not at the company standard.  Many times when our numbers are not great, it is usually because there are no rooms available to the guests due to hotel being sold out or because of MLOS.  In addition, there are also times when the guest has previously stayed at a hotel paying a certain rate for a room and they will call for a new reservation and are told the rate is a lot more than the previous stay.  This discourages the guest to not book the room due to the difference in rate.    I don't feel its fair that we are penalized for reasons that are out of our control.  Leadership should take a closer look at what's driving the ADR/CNV to decrease.  Perfect example is in September, when we had the two hurricanes.  Rooms were at a bare minimum, if not sold out altogether and calls were still coming in to book rooms...conversion was deeply affected by this because rooms were not available, but we were still expected to perform ""as usual"".  Totally unfair...","I wish that we would not be graded by stats, it would be nice to do your job without the pressure of VOC, ADR and conversion figures which we have no control over when receiving calls, we can't control the influx of our calls and when I receive calls to cancel, transfer to hotel, add notes to existing res and modifications I immediately feel dejected because I know that call will count against my stats and even though we are told that we are all receiving those calls I know for a fact that if I get 30 of them and someone gets 1 call it affects me. Same with ADR, we have no control when it comes to group rates, AARP, gov rates etc. It affects us all. I wish I was judged more on how I handle my calls than what type of call I get.

I don't mind the increase in hours at all, but the weekend requirement excludes an average and that seems to defeat the purpose if the BAS flexibility.

This structure is really old and the lightings on this is dark. There are cracks on the ceilings.   Another improvement is in our office. The work that we do seems to be a lot when we have phone duty. When we have phone duty, it makes us less efficient in our work. Having phone duty just makes our work load push back from answering guest complaints/inquiries. This should only be done by two or three people. If there's not enough then hire at least one more person to mandate this. It is unfair for us that our workload gets push behind while the main person who is answering the phones gets helped. When one of our team from our sections calls out or is absent, do we have a reliever that's assigned to us to do our work? No right. So why does the main person who is handling phone calls gets a special privilege when they are short staff. Please remove the phone duty from all of us in the office. That would make us feel a lot more happy when doing our work. If you ask the team members in the office what they hate the most about their job, I can guarantee you that all of them would say Phone Duty. So please hear us and remove the phone duty.

Equipment utilized within an operation play a major role in efficiency and quality of product. Having an adequate blender for instance is the difference between a smooth soup or puree, and a gritty or chunky unpalatable soup or sauce. Having a properly working oven, impacts the speed in which the meal is finished; which is important for meeting deadlines. Additionally faulty equipment presents many hazards for staff members. In the event that a piece of equipment is faulty and can not be repaired, it is always cheaper to replace it, than to compensate for the harm it may cause a fellow team member. Additionally if we are to uphold standards, and consistency, we must understand the role equipment plays in it.    My suggestions are as follows:  1.

Corporate office network infrastructure needs great improvement, as the network itself is very slow, both internally (accessing network shares) and externally (internet).  2. The lobby site is frequently unresponsive or does not return search results (that are definitely there to be found), and often you have to go through various steps to get it to function properly.  3. Enterprise Vault is horrible, it is frequently unavailable, and there are many messages that cannot be retrieved at all so they are basically gone because they cannot be accessed.  4.  The helpdesk needs to be moved to either the US or the UK.  Dealing with non-English speakers is very difficult and frustrating, which makes many people avoid contacting the helpdesk because of that.  Also, having a 3rd party helpdesk ask to take control of your machine is a red-flag issue that should be of great concern.  5.  In the McLean corporate location there needs to be more conference rooms and more huddle rooms.  There is no place to have a private phone call (huddle rooms), and it is often difficult to find a conference room for meetings.  6.  Add privacy panels/covers to the women's bathroom stalls in the McLean PP2 building (like there are in the PP1 4th floor women's bathroom).  It is unsettling to have big gaps in the bathroom stalls where the people at the sink/mirror can look directly into the bathroom stalls.",3145

The relationship between HR and our management in the office is very concerning and the entire team has discussed that we can't trust HR to support us when needed.   3.  There is no consistency in the office with discipline - why is okay for our managers to speak poorly of others in the hotel, including our own team members at times, but other times we're pulled into HR and pinned against each other to see ""who dislikes who"" and ""how uncomfortable the office is""?

During a week with multiple banquets, our department never seems prepared to keep all outlets stocked with supplies. Furthermore, during banquet events that take place outside, the amount of seating and the flow of the event seems to encourage guests of the event to use the gbar as a sitting area rather than a separate restaurant. This results in the restaurant being left a mess and blocking regular lunch and dinner guests from being able to use the restaurant.  Regarding the staff at gbar, everyone is very team oriented, however one of the bartenders does not follow this idea. She can be greedy, self-serving and manipulative in an attempt to swindle bartenders out of their ""good shifts"" with little regard to the other bartenders.

Hard to convince one's self to unplug when Sr. Leaders don't walk this talk.    Maybe the organization should consider twice a year sabbaticals for all team members -- shut the office down for a week at a time (Summer/Winter), like Chinese New Year, so that everyone has a real chance to relax and not be worried about the 700+ emails you'll need to dig through when you come back.

In addition, since differential pay for weekends and evenings are no longer available, there are no incentives for employees to want to work these hours creating staffing shortages. In my opinion, employees should be able to build reasonable schedules until BAS is closed. If we are overstaffed, LCV should be offered.

I am very disappointed in how it has evolved. The beauty of the program and the genius of it, was that no two weeks had to be built exactly the same but that you were ""guaranteed"" a certain amount of hours within an agreed upon ""core"". The removal of the core and I also believe the removing of extra pay incentives to compensate the workers who chose the ""undesirable"" hours has, along with poor staffing predictions, allowed the program to almost implode on itself. Without paying incentive to work undesired hours (late nights, weekend nights) those hours are not being willingly chosen. Then you have the issue that the more ""desired"" hours M-F 8AM-5PM are hard to get, then, you have a huge amount of people all logging in (even though work different departments) at the exact same time, rather than staggering start times, which causes the system to crash on occasion, to lag, to spin and error out and by the time you get to build, all the ""desired"" hours are taken and you are left with having to choose hours randomly throughout the day and often over all 7 days just to fit the hourly requirements in. It takes ALL of the flexibility out, all of the dependability out, and leaves us very unhappy and nervous about the schedule we are stuck with.

Overstaffed during the normally undesirable times because its the only option left for folks to build if they log in even 5 minutes late or have system errors.

Your vacation is at the mercy of hotel occupancy which is basically impossible in the summer when your children can actually go on vacation.  The only suggestion I can give is to hire a ""Summer Supervisor"" to allow managers to re-charge (even for a week in the summer).  We need to take into consideration managers' sanity and also know that they get tired after 10-12 hour shifts on a daily basis.  We don't need acknowledgement for the work that we do & the amount of time we put in.  However, please do not make us feel guilty if we want to go home ""on-time"" at least once a week so we can have dinner with our family.

Working on the managed team, we are not always encouraged to disconnect from work when we leave work but to forward our phone during busy times or to check email throughout the evening. It is even suggested that we check in on our hotels over the weekends and work if we need to. The work load of being on the managed team constantly spills over into 'life'. There is a culture on managed that we don't participate in Hilton social events throughout the office or attend off site functions if it cuts into the work day. I love being involved on a managed level and learning to deal with asset managers but the moral of the team is discouraging. When I take vacation I feel guilty fully disconnecting and am sometimes encouraged to stay connected on my vacations.

Company communication has gotten much better, the company culture has shifted to be much more positive and driven (maybe a bit of negative shift in job security lately), the health benefits have improved (although still VERY costly for family .. and would be better if less costly!), the travel program has been enhanced (although most of us don't have time to travel as the demands on work life have increased), and overall the benefits have improved (FMLA, etc.).

Currently the discount we receive through National is next to nothing. Pretty much every other car rental company is cheaper.  Resort Fees and Onsite Hotel Parking should be waived for team members on the travel program.  Every hotel should have a Human Resources Contact. Currently our hotel uses the General Manager as the HR person. This is a serious conflict of interest and she accomplishes nothing pertaining to human resource issues. Contacting corporate HR is also useless because you must leave your information and you cannot remain anonymous.   Schedules should be received in a timely manner. No departments should be excluded. Currently every other department gets their schedules at least a week in advance. If our department is lucky we will get it one to two days ahead of time.   Considering we must be open on holidays it would be great if we could receive time and half for holiday pay. Many people request holidays off and as an incentive a higher paid wage would be really appreciated. And the time and a half rate should be our PTO pay rate. Not our hourly under minimum wage rate.  The associates in our department our paid a minimum tip wage which is less than your regular minimum wage. Our PTO pay HAS NEVER INCREASED. This should be changed as we receive raises on our regular hourly tip wage. I.e. if I receive a ten cent raise on my $5/hour wage I should receive the same ten cents on my PTO pay.   Also we should not be bothered on our time off. If my manager is constantly texting, emailing, and making me take training on my time off I should be compensated for it.

Here is some points and smiles. Here is an amazon gift card. Instead we require an employee to do further work to reward them.  We need more flexible work hours, BAS is almost impossible because we do not have any options available for the time your looking for. Also it is difficult to get time off, we get the hours just not the options. With the increase in health care and cost of living, we need to create a higher pay scale for the lower end departments. You see other companies doing this as a trend because of the cost of living. I would like to see Hilton being on the news because of this. Since the health care change, prices have hit the employee each and every year, can we try to make it lower. I do not feel like I have the hardware or software to do my job properly. I am working on a system which were probably created in the 90's, they have several issues and lack options and hinder the person performance. I had to call customer service a few times, I am not sure why we have long hold times. We need to decrease this and never have the guest wait.

This would be cost-effective for Hilton to do and help DC residents to save money as well as efficiently work during our commute to/from work. A prime example of this is Google, which offers employees a shuttle to transport them from the office and into San Francisco. This has incentivized people to be able to live anywhere and still work effectively from the Google office in Silicon Valley, as well as helped employees meet each other through the shuttle commute.

The metro is incredibly expensive and can cost DC residents upwards of $10/day to ride; OR a shuttle that transports DC residents to/from inner city DC and the McLean office building. This would be cost-effective for Hilton to do and help DC residents to save money as well as efficiently work during our commute to/from work. A prime example of this is Google, which offers employees a shuttle to transport them from the office and into San Francisco. This has incentivized people to be able to live anywhere and still work effectively from the Google office in Silicon Valley, as well as helped employees meet each other through the shuttle commute. Additionally, we would all love to see a shuttle vehicle that can operate in the morning and evenings to provide transportation to/from McLean office and Tysons Corner metro station  - Potential partnership with WeWork  - Improved health/fitness program, which includes a stipend to be utilized towards health or fitness costs incurred throughout the month. This would align with the goals of the Thrive program and would provide a greater incentive to become physically active and healthier. I know that Thrive is meant to be inclusive of all team members; however, at some point there needs to be a separation and there could be benefits of equal value provided to other team members.  - Major changes to the internal promotion and compensation structure. With Hilton's current internal promotion structure, the company encourages team members to leave the company and then come back in order to receive the promotion and the compensation desired at a faster pace. Compensation is currently capped at certain percentages and values, which hinders one's ability to be promoted and receive a salary fairly","If we want to continue to attract great talent, we need to make our offices more advanced and cutting edge.

We are in constant competition with the app., other travel sites, etc to earn commission.  We should not have to compete with our own app!","I do not get paid nearly enough.  I believe working on the Luxury Desk should get a lot more than a $1.00 more per hour.  We provide excellent service and we should be paid accordingly.

It is pennies and if we had a commission based incentive that is more than pennies, you would get the return, the ADR, the upgrades.",388

They dictate the rest of the trip with the way that they greet and interact and provide a solid base for the guest to start their journey.  Yet the valet here in Hawaii get paid less than the starting wages at Mcdonalds or Jack in the box .  parking rates have risen so high that we are lucky to leave with more than 10 dollars tip !!! Ive parked 36 cars in one night and not one of them left a single dollar .   We may have porterage but its not enough to compensate for the cost of living on Oahu .  At this rate owning a house while keeping my same career would be next to impossible.   Valets and Door are the first step to happiness in a guests trip not to mention every day when we greet and send them off for the day.  We need to be compensated fairly and we may see a rise in scores as the morale of the team would be outta the roof .  When talking to other employees I have come to the conclusion that more fair compensation would lead to better guest scores as well as overall happiness of the hotel which means the bottom line that means so much to you will only grow as we become a better and more well rounded hotel.,"For  a ""high end"" resort and for ""high end"" service, we should be getting paid more than just minimum wage.

We often receive performance notifications by emails each month and we often get points and smiles all through the year, telling us how well we are performing, but when we get our annual assessments, we barely get a quarter as a raise. The pay as a full time hire doesn't meet the needs with the cost of living we have to endure. It is very low and yet more tasks are constantly being added to our job descriptions. As far as the health benefits, It is too costly considering the pay we receive and the fact that we can barely utilize it because we can't afford co-pays or the balances left after going to be seen at the Dr. Some families depend on just the income from Hilton full time employees. Hard to take care of a family not having competitive pay. We have to provide money for our own phones lines to do the job, and are not compensated for that...we also have to accept whatever hours available to work each week, which are slim and we do not receive shift differential for having to be stuck with only late hours. The system (BAS) states that we can work up to 12 hours each day, but there aren't even enough hours posted avail to take a 12 hour shift if that is what you choose to do. This is not building your schedule. To build your schedule, there should be options avail for you to select other than the same hours each day. These details make it very stressful and difficult to enjoy your job even when you want to. There are many elements that are great, but in these areas, I think Hilton would not have as many turn overs if employees could feel more job security and feel that they can take care of their families by working here.",With the increase in minimum wage continuing to rise each year and the starting wages are not continuing to rise it is hard to get good qualified candidates to even apply.

To ensure that hourly team members are being 100% productive it is necessary for their supervisor and department head to understand what they are supposed to be doing at all times. Some managers take excessive smoking breaks in the loading dock where a large sign says smoking is prohibited. Staff enter and exit past these people all day and its gives an impression that something is wrong. It is difficult to get a hold of these people when they are required to assist also. The employees that have to clean up the cigarettes also feel disrespected and many employees wonder why they cannot also go on excessive breaks.

There have been times that a client will complain and instead of getting a discount on a room or something they get their consumption comped and that is a direct hit to the banquet staffs gratuity.

Their are times that upper management is around ""helping"" on an event and they get frustrated and hostile towards the servers because of a situation the server had no knowledge.

But I was under the assumption we treat all our clients and parties the same, with excellent service.     We work really well as a team under Jarrod. HE IS AMAZING!

Everyone I talk to seems to be stressed to a certain degree from issues we have. First off is the renovation. I know that it is a struggle to keep everyone happy, but the company that has done the renovation has made so many mistakes and that has greatly affected the desk staff. Guests come to us with their complaints and we have to try to resolve these issues. I feel like the renovation process has just been executed very poorly and Hilton hasn't seemed to step in and intervene to help, which is disappointing. Another issue we constantly face is cleanliness of the property itself, this one is just getting to the point of being ridiculous. We get sooo many complaints from guests in house and through the SALT surveys. This is something that could be fixed but it doesn't seem to be happening. This is probably one of the most irritating issues this property is facing right now. The newly renovated rooms are having complaints due to not properly being cleaned. You can go in there and see dried drywall paste and putty on the walls and floors. I've also had it happen many times that guests do not have the supplies that should be in there at check in, i.e. hairdryers, conditioner, shampoo, and soap. This is a huge oversight at this level of a property. I've been told it's due to budget, which is not a good excuse. If you have to go over budget to buy the necessities then do it. We should not be running out of soap, shampoo, toilet paper, tooth paste, and other basic supplies. I get the same complaint from the kitchen. They say they don't have the supplies they need like eggs, milk, creamers and other such items due to budget and I find this to be ridiculous. Of the hotels I've worked at, this has not been an issue. It's things like what's mentioned above that has the staff at the desk at a low morale.

That is why I left most manager questions neutral. The banquet department has gone through many directors since opening. Although I agree that some of those directors were not a good fit, I believe the issues that fall on their shoulders begin elsewhere. The preparation and planning or lack thereof sets us up for chaos. As a banquet server, when I arrive for a shift I begin by receiving a BEO and obtaining orders from a banquet captain. However, more often than not, upon following orders the kitchen staff (i.e. chefs, cooks) arrives and needs to make major adjustments to our setup. Also, we are constantly waiting for food to be delivered. We have standards to be completely set 15min prior to a function start time. The kitchen seems to not care or understand the importance of being prepared in the front of house. When we are constantly running around making last minute changes it gives the appearance that we don't have our ducks in a row. Here is a perfect example: The day before Microsoft (an enormous and important group that had been talked about for months prior) I am assigned to complete ""dry"" sets for the next day. After finishing setup on 6 of the 8 stations the head chef and assistant banquet director came out and changed everything. I must stress that I understand the need for flexibility in this industry. We must please our guests and contacts, and make a function a huge success. However, making your staff double or triple work during a week when you expect most your staff to put in 50+ hours is ridiculous. The physical labor of placing 6ft cutting boards, lamps, plates, etc is extensive. I would assume the Banquet Chef has the most say in how his menu is presented. All I expect is that he properly relays that information to our banquet department before we arrive to setup.",double checking my rooms,141

If you do something well then we need praise/incentives to continue doing well. If you do something wrong, there is no backlash from it and people get away with far too many things. Instead of just hiring anybody to fill in the gaps, try getting people that already know what they are doing, people hired in the last year are still making silly mistakes that should not be happening at a hotel of this standard. Also, people are not trained on the simple things. These are the kind of things that stop the guest giving higher salt scores. Things like not knowing where particular rooms are, not knowing how to connect to the internet, giving false information about the rooms, not knowing the price of parking, not knowing how to deal with a guest that has a problem. Fix the wifi in the hotel, the speeds are awful and the connection is even worse. I'd say 50% of my job is helping people connect to the wifi, for them to just come back later on with exactly the same problem again. Put the price of parking included in the rate for the room. the other 50% of my job is to be stood on the desk being shouted at because of the price of parking. I understand nowhere is free parking nowadays and it is a lot of revenue for the company. But hidden charges if you check in before a certain time, more charges if you leave after 1pm. Change the ticket machines outside, they never work properly and compared to the newer one inside are a huge step down. With all the money you make from parking im sure a bit of it can be spent on new machines to improve the effectiveness. Having a weekly rota is a very difficult task to put up with as well. Again I understand the reasons behind it, but even a fortnightly rota would be so much easier to cope with. I could go on for days, but I'm running out of space. So basically things are far from perfect.

I have attended a pre-shift where this manager was verbalizing that another co-worker had received accolades, it would have been great if it would have stopped at that. Her next comment was how SHE (the manager) had been the one to make all arrangements but (in her words, whatever).    This is a person who constantly reminds her employees that praises should not be received for doing what is deemed as their assigned job, only when someone has gone above and beyond; Yet, she verbalizes how the employees don't appreciate what she does (purchasing equipment-part of her job-, purchasing linen-also part of her job, planning meetings-another part of her job, ect).  This is a manager who makes fun of her employees accents...  This is a manager who expects her employees to drop everything to come and cover, not for any emergency situation but to a lack of correct scheduling, should a person not be available there seems to be retaliatory actions in the form of scheduling employees in 9-10 day periods even though there's more that ""enough staff"" to cover.

I feel like we should be able to contest surveys cause sometimes we are scored low because we could not change a name on an account on the spot or we cannot change a current room rate to a lower rate they saw yesterday. Also, members can make mistakes in keying in the numbers for the survey where they are clearly satisfied on the comments but the score does not reflect that sentiment. It is  not fair that agents suffer from these things.   I think we should have a clear goal, a set score to aim for, not this desk average system where even if you are performing higher than the desk your percentile is still not good enough. On every criteria we have for CTE we have a clear set goal like for attendance and availability. We should align it with this just like how it was before. We are not in competition with one another. We are here to deliver the best possible customer experience possible. We should not have to worry about how we compare with other agents. We just need to focus on being hospitable and delivering the best possible customer service experience.  This leads me to the scoring 1-5 on customer service, if 2-4 is failing we should not even have that option. It gives the notion to members that 4 is still good, 80% where in reality it is not. It just needs to be straightforward. If we keep the 1-5 scale then all scores should be taken into account.  Customer Care department is a mixture of agents with different skill set.

My review looks as if it's my very first job in corporate, and the reviewer went down the row and selected all 3's, as if I've no experience and I'm just meeting what is required. And the comments that accompanied appeared to be standardized. I'm told that's because there are only so many 4's and 5's given out as reviews in each department.

A sales team member could achieve their quarterly goal and still be on a path to being let go from their job due to the pattern of how groups book business in a particular market segment.

My review looks as if it's my very first job in corporate, and the reviewer went down the row and selected all 3's, as if I've no experience and I'm just meeting what is required. And the comments that accompanied appeared to be standardized. I'm told that's because there are only so many 4's and 5's given out as reviews in each department.

For some reason I'm not getting the last box to open up for Rewards or Compensation so I will just say here that I believe it's sub-par and shameful. I can not conceive why it would be thought we'd be happy to pay taxes on a reward/gift. And the pay is too low for what we agents do in all department. Would the company be as prosperous if Reservations weren't taking calls, and the guest merely walked in to the properties. Would the Honors program be effective if Customer Care, Guest Assistance weren't available to promote the programs and assist guest with there concerns.

The lights are constantly going out and they should be fully replaced, not just the bulbs. Our Employee garage needs to have security cameras, in the stair wells and the main exits for those of us working night shifts or even during the day. I recommend looking into how FAU runs their parking. They can issue tickets, $10-$25, which I think is reasonably fair for someone who cannot follow the rules as other employees would. We need double decals, employees have the one in the front of their car, but we need one in the back. This way our security officers may know who is supposed to be in the garage for that day. On days of self parking and we do not have to park at Bible Town, we need a 24 hour notice that there would be self parking. Every shift  I arrive with 30- 45 min to spare before work just to make sure I have parking, since I never know when a group will be self parking. If we receive notice to park off property the same should be applied when we share our garage with groups. I also believe we need a parking meter, while Guests and members use the parking garage when permitted, there are multiple occasions when someone should not be parking in the garage and  does taking away parking for us employees.

In high inflation countries, corporate funded team members receive lower salary increases compared to hotel teams based in the same country. Both parties are paid in the local currency and they are both subject to same law and regulations, therefore there needs to be alignment in increase percentages.

If you were to ask me right now what the strategic direction is for marketing at Hilton, I wouldn't be able to tell you. Which is an issue, in my opinion. It seems that there isn't much of an overarching strategy by which we plan cohesively (brands, destinations, portfolio, etc). What this means is that when the company hits a revenue gap or risk, we throw something (anything) into market (a flash sale, rate discount, destination offer, etc). Without an overarching strategy, we are unable to determine the activities we should go to market with that would appropriately ladder up to our goals.

That worked for about a month and then there were no other hours available. I would love for BAS to be wide open. Plus I believe our incentives need to be restructured. As a res agent I get calls for almost all departments but yet can only make incentive if I meet the desk average for res sales. Calls that are not for reservations should not be counted against us and if they cant do that then we need higher pay to offset the other calls that kill our conversion,"I think the need to receive a certain amount of feedback per month in order to receive ""bonus"" opportunities, CTE etc. is really asking for me to fail. 30-40% of calls received in the evening are either for that evening or within the next two days. Another 20% are for groups. When most hotels are sold out, groups have expired or sold out, and cross sell is done without the guest booking a room they are less inclined to take a survey and if they do they are going to lead toward the negative as they did not book a room for whatever reason. For the ones we are booking are asking if they want to join honors, if they want a car, if they want an upgraded room etc. then HGV.  All the while engaging them to get to know their reason for travel. Sounds great! However if we do transfer to EHI or HGV, that eliminates another percentage of guests that may have given good feedback but are now not able to do so. In essence you could, make CTE, have 35% or greater conversion and not make CTE because enough people decided to either ignore the ability to answer or due to a transfer could not answer.  Sounds like Hilton trying to limit the amount of high performers and those who do make CTE with added criteria are not compensated an additional amount even though the criteria to achieve CTE has increased and it is totally reliant on the guest to take an additional step.","I took this position based on not worrying about my AHT, lately every review I am being told to lower my AHT.

It has been lousy the entirety of my tenure at the company, but lately seems to have become even worse. Our current manager has had one foot out the door for months now, yet never leaves. It seems as if they are disinterested in their job; leave early frequently; oftentimes have a short fuse, etc and that creates chaos.     The hiring/employment situation is also ridiculous. A parade of terrible, unreliable employees have been hired by this manager. They often don't last more than a month and are incapable of doing their job. I--personally--have referred THREE people to apply here. All of them are more than qualified; college-educated, mature adults. NOT ONE OF THEM WAS EVEN GRANTED AN INTERVIEW. When I asked both my GM and HR about this, their response was simply that ""they must not have passed our prerequisites to work here."" Umm...judging from the people who've come through the revolving door here over the last year and a half, I can't imagine what those pre-requisites must be. It's almost like the management doesn't want intelligent, capable help or that they are afraid hiring people on an even intellectual playing field will challenge their authority. In any case, it has left a bad taste in my mouth re: Hilton as a place to work.     In addition to these issues, it seems that the rules change on a daily basis--back and forth, and back again.     Certain employees are held to MUCH higher standards than others, and when this is brought up to GM it is met with hostility/iciness.    Scheduling is RIDICULOUS. I am often scheduled between 6-10 days CONSECUTIVELY, but the days are arranged so that I never receive any overtime. It is impossible to ever count on having a weekend off. In my department, one employee has been promised weekends off and gets them 95% of the time.

How this was handled made the process much more painful than it should have been.     Leadership seems to favor those with revenue management experience who get vast majority of major promotions whilst other functions are left out. Some not getting the promotions they deserve, despite strong performance or expanded scope of work.    Company is generally too under resourced and always too focused on controlling the number of head count. Things are made worse due to many positions left vacant for extended period of time. There is also no compensation for those covering for those vacancies despite having to put long hours to do so. Hope company will hire more junior team members to help with workload, as many managers and above spend a lot of time doing administrative work.

Today, over 40% of companies offer a flexible work week also known as compressed time.  The Federal Government has offered it for decades, and KPMG, Virgin, Basecamp, and others are all successful examples in the private industry.  It's done in different variations from a 9/80 schedule to 100% four day work weeks.  The approach is shown to improve productivity and well being.  The work of the business still gets done with proper planning and execution such as staggered scheduling in departments to ensure workflow continues flawlessly.  Expectations and guidelines are communicated across the enterprise to ensure productivity remains high and most employees gladly comply to keep such a benefit in place.

It has been lousy the entirety of my tenure at the company, but lately seems to have become even worse. Our current manager has had one foot out the door for months now, yet never leaves. It seems as if they are disinterested in their job; leave early frequently; oftentimes have a short fuse, etc and that creates chaos.     The hiring/employment situation is also ridiculous. A parade of terrible, unreliable employees have been hired by this manager. They often don't last more than a month and are incapable of doing their job. I--personally--have referred THREE people to apply here. All of them are more than qualified; college-educated, mature adults. NOT ONE OF THEM WAS EVEN GRANTED AN INTERVIEW. When I asked both my GM and HR about this, their response was simply that ""they must not have passed our prerequisites to work here."" Umm...judging from the people who've come through the revolving door here over the last year and a half, I can't imagine what those pre-requisites must be. It's almost like the management doesn't want intelligent, capable help or that they are afraid hiring people on an even intellectual playing field will challenge their authority. In any case, it has left a bad taste in my mouth re: Hilton as a place to work.     In addition to these issues, it seems that the rules change on a daily basis--back and forth, and back again.     Certain employees are held to MUCH higher standards than others, and when this is brought up to GM it is met with hostility/iciness.    Scheduling is RIDICULOUS. I am often scheduled between 6-10 days CONSECUTIVELY, but the days are arranged so that I never receive any overtime. It is impossible to ever count on having a weekend off. In my department, one employee has been promised weekends off and gets them 95% of the time. My days off are routinely weekdays, When I've brought up having a consistent 2 days off so I could get a part-time job elsewhere to boost income, this was not warmly rec'd.","I suggest going back to Core Hours.  You inexplicably removed core hours from the whole organization.  I have been here for almost 8 years, 5 of those years working mid, to late afternoons.  I have  earned the right to move to AM core and that's what happened to me a year ago.  However, for some odd reason scheduling /forecasting decided that it would be better to not have core hours and let people choose from a 24 hour scale.  About a month later, I keep getting emails (demanding, threatening) that we are not choosing the correct hours when we BAS and complaining we are SHORT staffed in the evening.  Ok, I know what caused that, do you?  That's what happens when you take people on a designated night core and allow them to BAS anytime.  There are people working early mornings that JUST got out of training.  Where is their tenure working afternoon/evening?? That's completely unfair that brand new people are able to work morning hours.  BAS has been horrible with avail hours.  I have to work one week over night hours and the following week afternoon hours and if im lucky, I can get a few morning hours.  I can't make a life outside of work, if I have NO idea when I could get hours.   It's a nightmare I feel like you have brought on yourself as an organization as well as your employees.  The amount of stress that myself and other agents go through because of this one single decision is astounding.  Since it was your doing, you should be held responsible for the ensuing mess, not the us who are struggling to get hours. 2nd thing I need to mention is the RESMART program that was rolled out to agents extremely premature.  I am confused as why a large, professional company would roll out a program that wasn't finished. It's a disgrace to read and use.  Time consuming, inaccurate and loss of sales. It's been almost 3 months and still remains awful to use and affecting my performance.

classroom,Topic_Like, Training and Development,36.5739348371,1.55049586287e-06,12,473,I love working for Hilton. I believe that Hilton has many opportunities for advancement. The training that is needed for this advancement is not easily accessible. The university is not very user friendly.  Proper help is needed  to point team members in the direction they are searching for. Managers are great at pointing out what is available but helping team members achieve their personal goals in moving forward is often time consuming. I believe the University needs librarians or mentors to help teach and to mentor team members with their career goals. Not everyone learns by reading or classroom teaching  some learn with hands on training. The thing I  believe that Hilton has recognize time and time again is that its team members is their greatest asset. Having something to look forward too and the feeling of making progress is in itself makes happier team members.,More classroom courses,The training department should revisit the former method of grooming future leaders for the hotel through the classroom model where experiences are shared. rather than the Online method where interactions is only screen.,485

Hilton policy should be applicable to all, there shouldn't be an exception when it comes to leadership positions. When there are openings or vacancies, certain positions are reserved for expatriates and the locals are told they should first go out to another location to get experience before you can come back to take up positions in your locality. But this does not apply elsewhere as locals are allowed to occupy such ""reserved"" positions. Therefore, it is my suggestion to Hilton that there should be Fair Treatment in this regards.  Another issue is the disparity of wages, benefits between the locals and the expatriates.","The Cross Training Exposure is being done in our hotel, and it is really very good. If in case there is no promotions or career growth in their department & the department that they did the cross training happened to have an opportunity/vacancy, how is it possible to consider those TM to join the department instead of hiring outside?

OJT should be given back to the individual department's operational DCs to help get new hires up to speed.  The trainers do not have the correct training and operational experience to be teaching the new hires.  They should be involved in calibration with operational DCs to stay current on operational expectations and needs.   New Hire training should be more strict in terms of attendance and availability.  When I was trained 5 years ago, if you missed one day of training, you were gone.  Now they come in with attendance and availability issues and they are unprepared to build and adhere to a schedule, which is critical with work@home staff.    Technical support continues to be a challenge and tools we need daily to do our jobs are not working properly.  Yet, team members and DCs are held to the same standards, effecting pay and disciplinary issues, whether these systems are working or not.  On top of that, we are expected to compete with other teams that have the new technology when we don't have that technology, which is unfair.

It doesn't seem to fit in well with our day-to-day workload and each team member is now expected to work a rather rigid schedule where they double as customer service chat reps at set times each week. The tool itself has been available for months and the team behind it, 24/7, has yet to implement any form of a pre-chat questionnaire. Because of this, there is no telling what topic you're going to have to answer in real-time with a hotel user, and editors are constantly messaging each other frantically during these chat sessions to try and locate an ""expert"" to help answer these questions.     We are already facing increased workloads with the addition of having to dual load assets into two separate DAMs leading up to our new CMS (which comes sometime in 2018), track all assets in a growing smartsheet (online spreadsheet), and adding/removing metadata fields to prep for migration. Adding mandatory Live Chat to our workload adds stress when we have to stop working on a request and transition to helping with the chat feature. To me it seems like Live Chat should sit with a specific ""Support"" team within Content Operations. If funding was allotted to have a small team of users dedicated strictly to customer service; i.e. live chat and the hotel content inbox, this would help ease some of the burden editors are facing with the ever increasing workload. The support team could have a master list with key users who are experts in particular areas of content, in case they receive case-specific questions during these chats and require more than a standard kind of response.",Work/life balance is hard for operations - maybe having a separate Thrive program for hotels and corporate,112

I would love to see MUCH more acknowledgement about the important role of safety and maintenance that Water Features does. We are also completely underpaid, so Hilton needs to review the structure of the water features deparment as well as compare how much we get paid at GWR versus all other hotels in our luxury category to see that Hilton needs to increase the Water Features pay immediately. Look at the HUGE difference in occupancy once the pools are closed versus when they are open and look at how much of an attraction for guests our pools and spas are. Without Water Features this hotel would be just another Days INN. Pay Water Features accordingly and make sure the GM AND Upper Management all support this and ensure it gets implemented ASAP!!!    On another note, The Property Operations Manager Gary Kiep needs to be held accountable for the severe lack of communication in the Water Features department. If I could give HIM ratings on his Management style and work thus far I would give him an absolute ZERO. He has been completely useless in managing Water Features, his communication to us has been absolutely nonexistent, and he has wasted hours upon hours of MY time having to correct his mistakes with my scheduling. He has ZERO compassion for a fulltime working Mother and has tried repeatedly to change my hours without my prior knowledge or consent.

Spa department which works alongside fitness has recently seen a pay restructure to £8.00 an hour.  A job that also requires a certain requirement and skill to do.  I feel that there should be a better wage for my department.  This can be incentivised by years of service where the pay would gradually increase to match your service.

The spa needs an automatic gratuity to maintain morale and retain staff. More budget needs to be allocated to the spa for basic equipment.

On top of that I received a 2% merit increase at the end of the year and was told that I had just gotten a raise through a promotion. So basically I was being rated on 2 months of the year in my new role in which I was on PTO for 3 weeks for my wedding and honeymoon. I was disappointed and felt like the rest of my year should have been part of my merit review and just because I was promoted that the rest of my year was disregarded? I felt that I had accomplished a lot and was deserved more than a low-end meets expectations increase.

I currently have student loan debt and in our department it seems we hire many people right out of college who could also be in the same situation.

We like to be able to have some personality with our guests to make it an enjoyable experience. We don't need to ask 5 million questions to help them. Or at least, don't make so many metrics REQUIRED.  Many people that call during my work day are busy and calling during their work time so they need to get their reservation made and get off the phone without the 3rd degree.  It is frustrating for them to have to go through so many phone prompts to reach an agent and then have us ask so many questions! We need to be allowed to match the pace of the guest and make that decision on our own. I understand that not all agents do the kind of job that I do but for those of us that are high performers, leave us alone and let us do our job.  You've placed so much unneeded stress on us about so many metrics, it makes us feel robotic. I personally feel more nervous these days than I ever have! It's starting to feel like we need to be worried about our job security with so many call centers located outside the US. It seems as though this company no longer values employees right here in the US and are just looking at the bottom line (almighty dollar) since you can pay those people much less and offer them no benefits. It's a shame to think it's come to that. Morale would go up if we weren't being nit-picked about every little thing.","Pay increase!!!!   Also, the scorecard scoring is not fair.  I do like customers rating my performance.  I have found when I do get a bad rating and they happen to leave a comment, it is always about the rate, hotel, no breakfast included....something out of my control but I get dinged for it.  The questions need to be asked differently or need to get rid of holding us responsible.  I also think the ADR and conversion % is unfair.  I get multiple dropped calls throughout my shift which greatly effects my conversion.  Also multiple calls of guests that want to be transferred to the hotel for diff reasons.  ADR is greatly effected because of government rates and group rates.  These are issues that we can not control but we get penalized for it.  I think the % rates need to be lowered to compensate these problems.  I think being rated on how much money in bookings you have made for the day based on how many hours worked would be more effective for the company and agent.    Health insurance for part time workers.","It would be nice if there was not a 32 hour weekend requirement for the agents that work remotely but its workable. do not change the way that BAS is done but open up a few more early morning shifts it makes it easier to work especially when you have school age children.  Provide some way that calls that are for information, checking a reservation, price checking or getting hung up on (anything that affects the numbers) can be coded so that they won't count against you.  Do a work from home positions that is only reservations not reservations sale.

This was raised in the last survey and to be honest this will be the last time that I am going to do this survey as the GM is not concern about this issue. The issue is with respect to Vacation days - presently I work Monday to Friday, however, I am required to take a vacation day for both Saturday & Sunday. How can this be fair ? Hilton is presently promoting work life balance and here it is that they are forcing you to use as a vacation day Saturday and Sunday - DAYS THAT I DO NOT WORK!!. I want to believe that the reason that nothing is being done about this is that the GM and Director of HR are expats so they do not care because most likely this will not be applicable to them. Also, just as an example, i cannot apply for one vacation day if it is on a Friday - they will force you to take three days ( Friday, Saturday & Sunday ).

To expand on this more, I would suggest the potential introduction of flexible working hours, e.g. working an extra hour a couple of days a week to be able to finish early on a Friday or being able to start work earlier/later and finish earlier/later. The latter would also mean there would be more cover on Content Gateway and Live Chat at hours where there are currently no or minimal team numbers working.

For example, everyone should get the same Hilton dollar amount contribution toward benefits whether they are single or married, opted into health insurance or not.     1) If you are covered under your spouse's health insurance and you opt out of health insurance from Hilton, you should get a biweekly credit in the form of a 401K or HSA contribution, paycheck, etc. of whatever flat amount is applied to everyone. Team members who do not get health insurance through Hilton completely miss out on the contribution applied to other team members.    2) The dollar amount applied to single vs. family health insurance should be the same for everyone, and that amount should also apply to those in point number 1, who do not participate in health insurance from our company. Right now single team members (as shown in their rewards/benefits statements) get a smaller credit from Hilton annually while team members with multi-person insurance plans get more than double the credit from Hilton (appears in rewards/benefits statement). This is based on conversations I've heard from team members discussing the inconsistent practice of applying different amounts based on single vs. multi person households.     I would think that Hilton would want to be a leader in practicing consistent benefit practices, especially since this directly impacts protected status groups such as LGBTQ, who may not, as a group, have as many team members with dependents for health care. I think providing the same dollar amount for every team member would be the most equitable practice. If all or a portion of the Hilton contribution is not used, the extra amount could be applied to a spending account or 401K for the team member on behalf of Hilton.

I wish there was an app or website that we could go to without having to log in Hilton's system to make a schedule when not working. Also I wish we could work more than 29 hours in a given week or make it more accessible. WFO is very hard to maneuver through and I have tried to pick up OT but it always fails.

I would like to be able to get rid of the added expense of my traditional landline.  I would also like to once again have the flexibility to build a few hours outside of my core shift.

My core shift is 4pm-midnight cst.  While I like to work evenings and nights during the week, I would love to be able to build some earlier Saturday and Sunday hours outside of my core shift.  In addition to that, I would really like to see someone create an app or a software program that we can use to build our schedule when we are out of town.  I have been out of town and have had to ask my DC to build my schedule in the past.

Many times when our numbers are not great, it is usually because there are no rooms available to the guests due to hotel being sold out or because of MLOS.  In addition, there are also times when the guest has previously stayed at a hotel paying a certain rate for a room and they will call for a new reservation and are told the rate is a lot more than the previous stay.  This discourages the guest to not book the room due to the difference in rate.    I don't feel its fair that we are penalized for reasons that are out of our control.  Leadership should take a closer look at what's driving the ADR/CNV to decrease.  Perfect example is in September, when we had the two hurricanes.

As far as the health benefits, It is too costly considering the pay we receive and the fact that we can barely utilize it because we can't afford co-pays or the balances left after going to be seen at the Dr. Some families depend on just the income from Hilton full time employees. Hard to take care of a family not having competitive pay. We have to provide money for our own phones lines to do the job, and are not compensated for that...we also have to accept whatever hours available to work each week, which are slim and we do not receive shift differential for having to be stuck with only late hours. The system (BAS) states that we can work up to 12 hours each day, but there aren't even enough hours posted avail to take a 12 hour shift if that is what you choose to do. This is not building your schedule. To build your schedule, there should be options avail for you to select other than the same hours each day. These details make it very stressful and difficult to enjoy your job even when you want to.

I was not told that Core Hours may not be available to me when I build my schedule. I noticed several days did not have any Core hours available to me in GA when I went to build. I couldn't build at all 3 days out of a week. I was only given an option to build on certain days and times, which made it seem more to me like a Set schedule.

If there were more opportunity to become a Full time GA agent with a BAS, then that would help out a lot of agents. GA seems to be busier than other desks, so maybe if more people were given an opportunity to become full time and build their schedule, then they would be properly staffed and if its too busy, lcv could always be offered for them and then would be able to take off work and Hilton wouldn't have to pay them. Just my thoughts. Also, it would be nice to have some hours outside of Core open up for agents weekly. Lastly, it would be nice to be able to switch departments even if you have not been on that particular desk for at least 3 months. Sometimes, an opportunity for a position you really wanted doesn't come available for a long time again, and if you have only been on a particular desk for less than 3 months, you cannot apply for it, so you miss out on an opportunity you have been wanting more than others.

LCV should be offered more evenly, some desks seem to always have LCV available and some rarely have LCV offered.  The ""hotel desk"" system does not mean anything anymore, everyone gets calls from all areas of the country and yet LCV is still offered by desk assignment - perhaps a seniority system would work better.","I would appreciate a  DC (development coach)  who is available.   My current DC (reservations) is very difficult to contact  unless you download an app for your phone.   Normal calls to her office phone or emails are usually  not returned.  I have had questions that I have asked and they are not usually never answered.   I go to Kb  articles and other agents through chat.  My DC is very nice,  friendly and personable.  It's just that she's  not easy to connect with and when you do,  she talks about her own schedule/etc for the majority of the time.  Especially about how busy she is.     When I started at Hilton and went through training I really enjoyed the team spirit and being able to communicate  with everyone.  Once I was transitioned to the sales floor,  I feel more alone and not able to really reach out to anyone  when I have a question or issue that arises.   We meet once or twice a month for 15 minutes to a half hour.  Most of the time is spent on chit chat about my DC.     I go to other agents via chat to get answers if I can't  find the answer in a KB article.  I'm really disappointed.   I really enjoyed the training and team feel but that doesn't   seem to have continued once I was transitioned out of training.  A group meeting once a month to get everyone  on the team together would be great so we can touch base and connect.   I realize not everyone's schedule allows  that but surely we should be able to get most of the team together. I don't even know who else is on my team.    I love the job but I am disappointed with the team I am on.   I don't want to create issues so I do not request to go  to another team.  I do not want to have any problems at work .  I am very happy working for Hilton as a whole.   I am independent and am ok working alone.   It is just disappointing after the great training experience I had.","The reason I chose work/life balance is it is the closest I can come to one of the biggest hick-ups I see on almost a daily basis now that we are coming out of peak season.  That balance would be the LCV offered to different hotel desks and not across the board.  I understand that business needs are taken into consideration when LCV is offered, but what I don't get is that as soon as that is offered to one desk it may change the calls that we are getting.  As a Northeast agent I am gated to take those calls, which is not in fact the way the calls come.  I get calls from all over the country in any given hour.  Gated may mean one thing, but from an agents standpoint we are taking calls as needed. These are hotel desk calls please keep in mind I am not implying other desks like GA or CC.  Perhaps LCV should come to tenure employees first, based on years of service. I bet you would find less turnover if you gave agents another reason to stay here longer.  Agents with years of service LCV or ALCV.  It would balance my life better with a 40 hour a week job after 10+ years to be able to take some much needed time off.  Evern if it comes in the increments of 1 hour at the end of my shift based on business needs. Thank you~",605
VOC,_VersionCH, Corporate,349.878675922,1.95647756958e-81,90,341,The CTE award is a great tool but the VOC & FCR scores do not be accurate. Since they have came out with those to me they are always wrong. If a guest select the wrong number in the VOC it can mess up your whole percentage. I just do not think that your whole award should be based on the VOC & FCR scores. Sometimes people choose not to do the VOC & FCR and if they do then your percentage is low so you are not eligible for CTE. The award program need to be revisited and I think the supervisor should have more say so in that award. The scores are not accurate nor trustworthy. It is always something wrong with them and then they came out in the middle of the 2nd quarter and those numbers where still used to base if you get CTE or not. The award program is definitely something that needs work on because I work hard the whole quarter thinking I am going to make it and don't. It is really discouraging more than encouraging.,"VOC is a new metric we must now meet. All guests have always heard the prompt that their call is being recorded for quality assurance and to stay on the line  for a 2 question survey. They have always had the opportunity to express their feedback so nothing has changed for the guest.  As resv agents  we must now get a yes (1) for first question and a ""5"" for our second question.  Anything else, even a 4 is considered a failure. We also have a minimum percentage to meet. Some people  with never give a perfect score as they feel there is always room for improvement!  Also, most happy customers don't take time from their busy lives to take a survey.  This is something we cant force them to do this even though these surveys will now determine if we receive incentive money and pay raises . There is a minimum requirement of surveys to meet. This is especially difficult for those reservation agents who are leading in HGV/EHI transfers.    I understand VOC is important feedback for HILTON but it feels like another metric to worry about that we don't have a lot of control over.","The new VOC added to our monthly stats is simply unfair!  We already have to ask a bunch of questions to make a reservation, and enroll in honors in not already a member. Then we must offer both EHI and HGV to our guest as well.  most guest just want to make a reservation and get on with it,  To hold us accountable for whether or not the guest takes a survey and to dock us on our score card if they do not is plain and simple unfair treatment.  We have absolutely no control over whether they will stay on the phone or not to take a survey.  Now to require that we ask the guest or inform them of the survey (like we are required to do for HGV and EHI where applicable) is absolutely something we can control.  But to hold us accountable and have this affect our stats, and our pay is not feasible or fair!",431

Reporting - Need to have better timing with rolling out new reports especially if you are going to make them all mandatory.  None of them are supported by the RAT team so when they don't work you have to search someone down in the RMCC to see if is user error or it is a fault in the tool.

In my opinion, choosing a particular route within the RMCC for a career path no longer provides the opportunity to move to a remote position in the future.  As we grow in the RMCC, I would really like to see that leadership is conscious of the balance between tenured team members vs. advancement opportunities to avoid turnover.  I would also suggest that leadership be more mindful of how they approach team member's career aspirations in order to not dissuade them from their goals simply because peers have been working on the same advancement opportunities for a longer time period.  Everyone should be weighed by their contributions and performance rather than how long they have been in their current role prior to moving into an advancement role.",373

And the ""numbers"" keep movingand the ""goal post"" keeps moving.  I feel like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football and HRCC is Lucy.  Our calls are longer and longer because of ""discovery""when most people just want to make a reservation and they see right through the ""discovery""some of them coming right out and saying ""don't try to raise the price, just give me the cheapest room you have""  And the metrics and numbersand the ""wheel""so many things we have to doand I can tell by the calls that they guests know that things have changed.

We are getting so much ""service"" calls nowand a lot of it is CORRECTING OVERSEAS-MADE outsourced reservations.  You get what you pay forand on my end I see a lot of mistakes that I then have to correctbut that goes against MY NUMBERSas each of those ""service calls"" lowers my CONVand thus lowers my raise.  Like VOC lowers my raise.  These people don't want to take a 2-question survey after they've been on the phone for 20 min just trying to book a roomthey just want to hang up.  And if they do take the survey, they click the first option ""1""which kills us.  Overseas res has better VOC % because they don't have the same standards we dothey just book and go.  I would take their survey if I were calling them.  Nice to be able to just make a reservation without a thousand questions.","HRCC is run like a Circus.  I suggest realizing it is 2017- people do not want their hands held- they do not want to tell their life story. They want to make their reservation, get a clean room at a fair price and be on their way. The news Res 2.0 and 'Wheel' is a waste of time, I suggest benching this and empowering us to have organic conversations with our guests. We are becoming scripted robots.  I suggest investing money in the software we use.  It is maddening, day after day, having at least one of my tools not working.  If upper executive management is aware of how HRCC is operating, it is obvious they do not care about team member satisfaction.  If they are not aware, I suggest they take some time to look around. Agents are constantly having to worry about our ""numbers,"" yet we have arbitrary moving targets to reach.  Each day is something new, and the only focus is on finding ways the punish us, not empower and enrich us. I have been with HRCC for many years, and the changes I have seen are not at all for the better. Morale is at an all time low among team members- we are in fear of our jobs being outsourced, and many are quite unhappy. I stay for GO Hilton, and build a schedule.  Even the guests are feeling it. I spend my days fixing reservations made by overseas agents, or assisting third party booking site agents do their jobs.  I suggest we STOP using third party sites.  Southwest Airlines is the #2 profiting airline in the US. They consistently receive awards for outstanding customer service- here is one place to purchase tickets for Southwest- directly from Southwest. They are not on Expedia, or  booking.com. I suggest you look long and hard at how HRCC is run, and make immediate changes to agent expectations and treatment. At this point, I am trying to finish my ten year ""sentence"" to get my lifelong FTP benefits. It's really quite sad. I used to LOVE my job, now I dread ""auto in"" each day.  Shame on you, Conrad did NOT envision this. PAY ATTENTION!!","It is a shame that Hilton decided to use an outside company like FPG and pay them who knows how much money. We are blessed to have very talented agents, DCs and managers who are experts in what WE DO. FPG isn't. FPG has basically integrated into our protocol, a protocol that you hear on the phones if you call anyone in a business atmosphere these days. Everyone is using the transition to discovery, etc. WE NEED TO STAND OUT as an industry leader, not be just like everyone else. Our own talented, experienced employees that are top performers should have before and should now take what FPG created and adjust it to the Hilton way...a way that would make us shine above everyone else. Agents should be trusted to lead the call in the direction the guest needs, not insist on being travel agents to guests who have already done their research, already know what they want, are in a hurry or are business travelers needing a corporate rate. We are not trusted as employees and it hurts morale. Last week when I asked what brings you to the area, the guest responded, next question. As agents, we need to have some flexibility to handle our calls, not try to trick business travelers into an upgrade when we know they need to travel at their company per diem. This job used to be fun. We could occasionally have a call where we really connected with someone. Now we have so much to remember, that even though I am no longer just an order taker as I was originally taught, I feel even more robotic than ever trying to fit in everything FPG drummed up for us to say. I'm not suggesting we throw the baby out with the bath water, but I am suggesting that we take this plan and morph it into something original. We want to stand out in the industry? Res 2.0 is not the way to go. And just out of curiosity, overseas locations are producing more calls than we are. Are they using Res 2.0? Should we be concerned about job security?

McLean,_VersionCH, Corporate,259.460591133,6.02101496746e-60,67,173,"I strongly believe the following should be implemented as benefits for team members:    - Improved commuter program, which includes a stipend to be utilized towards transportation costs to/from work. The metro is incredibly expensive and can cost DC residents upwards of $10/day to ride; OR a shuttle that transports DC residents to/from inner city DC and the McLean office building. This would be cost-effective for Hilton to do and help DC residents to save money as well as efficiently work during our commute to/from work. A prime example of this is Google, which offers employees a shuttle to transport them from the office and into San Francisco. This has incentivized people to be able to live anywhere and still work effectively from the Google office in Silicon Valley, as well as helped employees meet each other through the shuttle commute. Additionally, we would all love to see a shuttle vehicle that can operate in the morning and evenings to provide transportation to/from McLean office and Tysons Corner metro station  - Potential partnership with WeWork  - Improved health/fitness program, which includes a stipend to be utilized towards health or fitness costs incurred throughout the month. This would align with the goals of the Thrive program and would provide a greater incentive to become physically active and healthier. I know that Thrive is meant to be inclusive of all team members; however, at some point there needs to be a separation and there could be benefits of equal value provided to other team members.  - Major changes to the internal promotion and compensation structure. With Hilton's current internal promotion structure, the company encourages team members to leave the company and then come back in order to receive the promotion and the compensation desired at a faster pace. Compensation is currently capped at certain percentages and values, which hinders one's ability to be promoted and receive a salary fairly","I commute into McLean daily as do other people. It would be a great benefit but also ensure safety of the McLean team members if a shuttle was provided to the metro. There is no convenient cross walk to get to the bus stop that heads back to Tysons Corner Metro. Team members either walk out of the way to safely cross the street to the stop or take the stop closer to the building, which then takes then 10-15 mins out of the way to Spring Hill metro. What ends up happening in most cases, because people want to get to the metro quickly, is a dangerous game of frogger. If Hilton doesn't provide a shuttle, then working with the city of McLean to get a crosswalk in the middle of Jones Branch would be incredibly beneficial. Additionally, it would be a great benefit if we had Uber Credits that could be purchased for rides to the office.","I would suggest 2 improvements. I think the company should offer a free shuttle for Hilton team members to and from the McLean office and the Tyson's corner metro during the mornings and the afternoons. The Fairfax county shuttle that currently runs is not reliable.The second suggestion would be to implement a flexible work from home culture company wide. I do not feel that we currently do not have anything established that promotes working from home, it is actually greatly discouraged. This makes it difficult to have a work/life balance, to schedule doctors appointments, etc.",240

The help desk are a joke now. I don't even bother calling. Most I cant understand them.","The training and development program needs a complete overhaul--new hires are not anywhere near operational levels when they complete training.  OJT should be given back to the individual department's operational DCs to help get new hires up to speed.  The trainers do not have the correct training and operational experience to be teaching the new hires.  They should be involved in calibration with operational DCs to stay current on operational expectations and needs.   New Hire training should be more strict in terms of attendance and availability.  When I was trained 5 years ago, if you missed one day of training, you were gone.  Now they come in with attendance and availability issues and they are unprepared to build and adhere to a schedule, which is critical with work@home staff.    Technical support continues to be a challenge and tools we need daily to do our jobs are not working properly.  Yet, team members and DCs are held to the same standards, effecting pay and disciplinary issues, whether these systems are working or not.  On top of that, we are expected to compete with other teams that have the new technology when we don't have that technology, which is unfair.  Not enough is being done to communicate operational needs/issues to senior leadership and/or apologies/compensation delivered when things are known not to be working and affecting pay and job performance.","I have been at Hilton for almost 17 years and I have been a DC for many of those years.  I have had some OUSTANDING leaders and peers.  However, I absolute do not feel comfortable with the team I am currently a part of.  I feel the tone trickles down from Senior leadership.  Managing with fear, favorites, and distrust sets the tone for the team. Our Senior Manager, Virginia Lozano-Weber, who at one point I fully trusted and respected, causes a great division amongst our team.  While she sends me to workshops that encourage a culture change and encourages us to challenge process, she really does not support it unless it is something she agrees with.  This has become very evident in meetings we hold with her as she is very withdrawn if she feels we ""challenge her"" or if we question processes that she may support.  I do not think it is a positive example when she uses terms like ""invisible wall"" to describe an unspoken separation.  I just wish she will be more conducive to supporting our group team efforts and not make things an ""us"" vs. ""them"" type of environment.  As a result of this management style my fellow DCs will not share projects they are working on, we do not work together to make our department successful unless our direct manager gives instructions, I also believe she discourages the DCs on QA and HD, not to respond nor communicate amongst each other.  Our senior leaders need to develop the talent within our company instead of always looking outside.  If our VPs want degrees or think that those who have degrees are more valuable, this needs to be relayed to the masses.  I received my associates degree and now almost complete with my studies for my Bachelors in business management.  I do not feel the same support nor investment that I see with the college recruits and new DC hires.

The legacy is removed on a lot of properties now so we can't look at that when ReSmart isn't updated. I would like to see the moving between screens quicker.

Not a fair system.","Because I love my guests so much, I stress out when I feel I'm being pushy so far as offering HGV/EHI, MLOS and other things.    When I have a guest that just wants to take one night off a three day stay or wants to add a night and doesn't mind changing rooms, but I can't and for no real good reason.  That leaves my guest questioning.  And me as well.  I don't understand all the in's and out's of how revenue is made and MLOS,, but I do understand when my guest is frustrated because we both know there is a room to be had and he can't have it.  I know this is a hotel thing and not so much  ""Hilton"" thing, but maybe you can help us out by giving us a better answer than ""Sorry, it's so we don't inconvenience the guest.""  But he's already there because he can't book at that hotel for an extra night and they are okay with moving.    Anyway, other than that.  I'm not sure what improvements need  made.  Job security may be one.  Trying to keep up the numbers.  That is a huge stressor at times.  And trying to meet all the checkmarks on the sheet.  Please, if our numbers look good and our VOC and calls sound good, please let us do our job.      Many of us LOVE what we do, but stress over numbers and that plays a huge role in how we do what we do.  We tend not to focus on our guest because we're to busy making sure we offer PPP and EHI in the right place and Oh, did I do discovery and man, I think I forgot to.....    Please, trust us to take care of our guests.  Those who are people driven will always do so because we're concerned with THEIR happiness, not lining our own pockets.  That will easily come when we take care of our guests.    I always say, when a guest says they'll call back, I may have lost that sale, but because of my service, Hilton will always get that sale.

FCR,_VersionCH, Corporate,172.973727422,2.97264343387e-20,22,409,The CTE award is a great tool but the VOC & FCR scores do not be accurate. Since they have came out with those to me they are always wrong. If a guest select the wrong number in the VOC it can mess up your whole percentage. I just do not think that your whole award should be based on the VOC & FCR scores. Sometimes people choose not to do the VOC & FCR and if they do then your percentage is low so you are not eligible for CTE. The award program need to be revisited and I think the supervisor should have more say so in that award. The scores are not accurate nor trustworthy. It is always something wrong with them and then they came out in the middle of the 2nd quarter and those numbers where still used to base if you get CTE or not. The award program is definitely something that needs work on because I work hard the whole quarter thinking I am going to make it and don't. It is really discouraging more than encouraging.,"The new VOC added to our monthly stats is simply unfair!

All guests have always heard the prompt that their call is being recorded for quality assurance and to stay on the line  for a 2 question survey. They have always had the opportunity to express their feedback so nothing has changed for the guest.  As resv agents  we must now get a yes (1) for first question and a ""5"" for our second question.  Anything else, even a 4 is considered a failure. We also have a minimum percentage to meet. Some people  with never give a perfect score as they feel there is always room for improvement!  Also, most happy customers don't take time from their busy lives to take a survey.  This is something we cant force them to do this even though these surveys will now determine if we receive incentive money and pay raises . There is a minimum requirement of surveys to meet.

Resmart,_VersionCH, Corporate,157.248843111,2.12686713764e-18,20,166,"Everything needs to be consistent.  I have many friends that work for Hilton always making CTE when they don't follow the rules as they are supposed to.  I mean by top selling down, asking for car rental, giving details on room descriptions, having overall conversation with guests getting the best guest experience.  I do all of it just as I was trained to do and yet I can never get CTE anymore and these violators keep on doing the wrong things just to get a quick sale and move on and they get all the praise.  I don't think it's right to give praise to the ones that don't follow the rules.  They cheat and take away from us employees that do follow the rules and sell the way we are supposed to.     The other thing is LCV.  I work the NE Desk and it seems I have to stay up until midnight the night before to even try to get any LCV.  Other desks get it all the time.  I am not an abuser of LCV and never have been since I started working here almost 7 yrs ago but sometimes something comes up or I feel ill and would like an hour or 2 of LCV and none for my desk.  Then I get slammed with calls from all the other desks that were let off with LCV. Would like to see fair offerings on all desks for LCV and not forget about our NE Desk folks.  The Help Desk has not been very helpful lately.  I had one today and her name was Patricia.  She was reluctant to call the hotel for me when the guy said he had a direct bill and this hotel had nothing listed in Resmax or Ressmart for any Direct bills or even corporate account info.  The Help Desk seems to be terrified to call the hotels anymore.  She told me to send him back to the hotel and I lost the sale.  VOC - I really wish you would go back to the old way on VOC and not hold us so accontable if the gst does not do the survey.  I tell them to please stay on the line and do the brief survey but most of the time they don't.  Not fair that we get that held against us.    Resmart - many of the hotels are still nt up to date yet & missing info","In reservations, the new ResSmart a lot of the hotels don't have the info in them, I come across so many that don't have the food info times, etc. or recreation listed, a lot say they don't have a pool when in fact they do.  Getting these updated would be very helpful, it takes a lot of time to switch between screens and not having the info quickly leaves the guest feeling/knowing you are not onsite. I think if these were filled out better it would make the guest's experience better and quicker for them as well as a little easier to answer their questions quicker.  The legacy is removed on a lot of properties now so we can't look at that when ReSmart isn't updated. I would like to see the moving between screens quicker.  And in the room descriptions some key words bold or highlighted to make it easier to pick out what guest is looking for such as a sofa bed. When it's buried in a big paragraph it would be nice to quickly see certain words.","Getting input from agents before major changes to software being made (i.e. ResSmart was launched in an incomplete manner and caused stress to agents, because we had no information and the formatting of ResSmart is still not as helpful/resourceful as Resmax).",186
ADR,_VersionCH, Corporate,153.317622033,7.58792035329e-35,40,150,"The constant pressure to sell is very demanding, while in a reservation position. The communication with some DC's feels like a constant scolding of how CNV/ ADR numbers are not high enough. The stress from upselling customers on every single call is exhausting and can drive one to thoroughly dislike their job. While I LOVE customer service, and truly thrive in assisting others, the ever pressing demand of ""sales goals"" is an emotional strain. All of this on top of ending every call with an HGV transfer feels like harassment for agents and the guests.","We need a better way to be rewarded for the work we do.  I love HGV and we should not change this incentive.  But, I think for the amount of training and new procedures that have been added over the years, we need to either give a higher wage amount or make the monthly ""ADR & CONV"" incentives work in our advantage. Don't you want to encourage us to make those big sales and upgrade rooms? If the incentive payout gives us a few dollars a day, no one is going to be encouraged to work harder and make big sales.  There was a 2.0 iEarn incentive that took place with some teams as a trial.  That payout made a huge difference to peoples financial stability. We should incorporate that iEarn 2.0 Incentive plan into every team just the way it was set up for the trail teams! That really made employees excited to work hard on raising their conversion, ADR, and overall Revenue for the company! The monthly incentive program that we have currently with ""scorecard"" is just not motivating at all.  I want to be motivated and that can be done by giving us a much greater incentive, aka iEarn 2.0.","We need a raise.  Get rid of ADR, CONV and HGV transfers.",190
banquet,_VersionCH, Hotel,28.3650749953,9.37204197066e-21,447,757,"I would suggest that money be put into more reliable supplies for the kitchen and for the restaurants; including more staff for the kitchen like food runners, expediters, line cooks, supervisors for multiple restaurants, servers and bartenders.   Also basic supplies for dining like plates, baskets, silverware, linen, glassware, and silverware. It seems that most of the supplies are shared between all restaurants and banquet events. During a week with multiple banquets, our department never seems prepared to keep all outlets stocked with supplies. Furthermore, during banquet events that take place outside, the amount of seating and the flow of the event seems to encourage guests of the event to use the gbar as a sitting area rather than a separate restaurant. This results in the restaurant being left a mess and blocking regular lunch and dinner guests from being able to use the restaurant.  Regarding the staff at gbar, everyone is very team oriented, however one of the bartenders does not follow this idea. She can be greedy, self-serving and manipulative in an attempt to swindle bartenders out of their ""good shifts"" with little regard to the other bartenders. She also will make an effort to keep large tabs open with guests even when they leave the bar to sit at the tables in the restaurant, which effects the servers as well. All of this has created resentment from the staff, which has made a negative impact on the team morale. This is not fair and should be regulated more closely.  The current situation with our managers seems very rough from an outside perspective. Ryan has been doing an outstanding job running our entire department for the last several months, all of the staff loves and respects him. I am sure that he appreciated having a director to take some of the work load off but it seems that Jeremy needs to work on communicating changes being made and be more receptive to listening to Ryan's input given his years of experience at this hotel.","For such a large company, it would be great to have the equipment needed to bring us up to the 21st century.

Every department is important at any hotel but, how can an employee be satisfied with their work when a department lacks short on materials.

Instead of Managers passing on their work responsibilities on to Supervisors.  Expecting the Supervisors to fulfill the Managers duty.  Also fairness.

Even though it was the same exact thing that a different person done before.    How about if someone has potential moving up in Hilton.  Why not pull that person aside and give them the opportunity.  I know I can do more for the Hilton brand.  But because I'm in a lower position in the Hotel.  No one takes the time to know that I can offer more than just current job.   More mentoring. Giving employees the chance to move or give the option.  Managers act like managers.  If a conflict occurs with a guess.

I am constantly having to rush around the uniform room looking for any pants I can wear on shifts. a lot of the shirts also have huge holes in the arm pits and some days I have noticed people wearing black jeans fro home or no apron because there is such a shortage.  Quite often we are short on staff. we usually have to get people in from catering to cover busy shifts or cover sick days which makes it uncomfortable and stressful calling in sick because you feel like you don't want to let the team down.,"First of all, I enjoy my job. Unfortunately, the pay is exceptionally low and the health benefits offered are under-whelming and very expensive for such a low paying job. My aunt called me to let me know that Taco Bell was hiring for 12.50 an hour and my daughter makes more working for Starbucks. I actually expected much more from Hilton. It is such a well known brand that I was sadly surprised. The travel benefits and the time off offered is really good!     Another area for critique would be the uniforms. When hired on, there weren't actually enough uniforms available to be assigned. The one shirt I did receive was of good quality, easy to wash and dry with a crisp presentable look. When I did receive the additional shirts, they actually need to be ironed daily to make them look presentable. Not sure why anyone would issue wool skirts as a uniform either. They are not user friendly, requiring drycleaning or at least a cold wash with a line dry. There is more upkeep required. The drycleaning offered by the hotel only goes out every few days and I have heard you may or may not get your items back in a timely matter. As I wear clean clothing on a daily basis, it would just be so much easier to receive a user friendly uniform or provide my own skirt or pants. I would also say I am surprised that I often see uniforms in all departments that are in need of repair or are in need of cleaning/pressing. In my experience, that first impression is so important. If we look good then people will immediately assume that we are good. if we don't meet there expectations as a first impression then it is a uphill push to convince them that everything that follows will be good!  Just a thought...    In my third area of observations... I really appreciate the lunch provided by the Hilton.

If your hotel is not up to standards or you don't have what you need when you travel your going to get a lot of angry guest and bad reviews and people will not stay at your hotel. We are a downtown hotel so when people book our hotel their expectations are higher then to them booking a hotel in our local areas. which we all as employees should understand that as well. Housekeeping is unorganized we need more staff in housekeeping it is starting to be overwhelming when you try to save money and overwork one individual in each section of housekeeping . sometimes it be so much laundry that needs to be clean and our machines half work or dryer machines are out and they do temporary fixes to get them back running. With our housekeepers you giving the girls a time limit to be done by the end of the day and the girls are doing basic cleaning rushing through the rooms an attend to forget things.We are all humans we can be forgetful and make mistakes but those mistakes could be prevented a lot if our housekeepers were not so overwhelmed an stressed due to the amount of rooms they are doing a day. Our rooms are not regular rooms as the other hotels we have suites which their is more space to detail clean more items as refrigerator and microwave to clean. In other hotels its just the room bathroom and bed. And they give you 14 credits. Its a difference. Plus the new rooms are more difficult than the older rooms cause now you have carpet and hardwood floors so you are doing double work on cleaning the new rooms with cleaning the floors. We need vinegar for the water stains because the water in the hotel is hard. we need to find what product would be best to use on the floors because our product is starting to discolor the floors that are being newly renovated. We need to have all items like soap laundry bags toilet paper shampoo conditioner lotion over stocked. So we don't run out during big events.,2298
union,_VersionCH, Hotel,9.7624193089,7.78945130409e-12,310,14,"Pay non-union workers at a rate that is closer to union workers within the same department to avoid the disparity of compensation, in the form of monetary discrimination and prejudice.","The health benefits for non-union team members the cost are to high, and our pay rate are as the same as a union team member whose health benefit are less expensive.","While union employees have regular pay increases, I feel like the non-union employees often go without fair pay because we do not have representation.",324
breakfast,_VersionCH, Hotel,9.70942028986,4.14209595547e-09,231,4519,"I said about this last year and the food provided to staff is still awful. Just to illustrate the point, I went down there at the end of last week and they had beans out which were burnt and covered with a layer of skin over the whole tray. I cant imagine baked beans being a very hard thing to cook really and I know for a fact they are served at breakfast to guests and if they were served like they were to us then you would have a lot of complaints coming in so why should we be any different. I also know for a fact this view is shared by my team members and also other hotel team members. Its not if we are asking for caviar and lobster every break time but some decently cooked, nutritious meals with some variety would be good.   Another thing is that when the food is bad then we can end up not eating so I used to get food from the bar but I have since been told I cannot order food from the bar, so some shifts I can end up having no food... I personally don't think there is anything wrong with ordering food from the bar. Fair enough if you want to limit times when we can order as I understand they may be busy during lunch and dinner times but we should be allowed to order outside those times. Plus its not as if we are getting it for free we are still giving the hotel money. What's the difference between us using our staff discount on shift compared to using it not on shift?","The main one that comes to mind is that theteam dining room needs better food. It isnt a matter of cooking at this point. the options givent are super unhealthy. bacon or sugary ceareal are not good options for breakfast. the health of the staff has to be a number one priority. I have noticed that there is never a day in this hotel that a large portion of the team is sick. a large factor of health is what people eat, the food during lunch is a rare chance to be good, let alone good for you.   For example: Right now while i was taking this test two people have walked past coughing, and this morning there was no breakfast, there wasnt even one.   Also breakfast starts too late for the people who get to work early.",Better food for breakfast at the cafeteria. There is nothing for breakfast.

kitchen,_VersionCH, Hotel,9.43806531232,1.85022643489e-26,751,1370,"The main suggestion I would have would be the conditions of our equipment Dishwasher, ovens, Walk In Coolers, Kitchen Line Heating elements.","We have been operating in banquets with poor or missing equipment this is on going, the BOH is dirty and the floors a safety hazard as well.We can use some more management in banquets ,maybe one more like Eddie will suffice or an active director like Max Harris was , there is no presence on the floor and the absence of such gives way to another set of problems with all Banquet staff, from stewarding, kitchen and serving.","new equipment in the kitchen. stoves, grill, ovens.",2121
front office,_VersionCH, Hotel,9.19002990317,5.29758553889e-11,292,9017,"I have a fantastic General Manager along with a great Director of Sales to work with--we are fully aligned in terms of making the right financial decisions for the property.  They demonstrate integrity and have helped create a great team of people in the Embassy Suites sales office.  The rest of the executive team is awesome including the main departments I work with closely including HR (Adam), Front Office (Rasha), Housekeeping (Blanca).  The sales team that is currently in place works hard & is fully on board to booking quality clients and providing fantastic service.  Secondarily--the compensation for my position is decent and the benefits are extremely good (healthcare, retirement, TMTP, etc).","Training workshops and meetings for departments other than the front office managers, AGMs, and GMs. What about Engineering, Finance, Human Resources, etc?","The most important factor that makes my working here suitable is the front office manager, the general manager and the human resource team.",9309
more staff,_VersionCH, Hotel,8.72212427785,3.91409428698e-17,554,1583,"The scheduling is very very poor. Even just in my department, I see regularly that we don't have enough staff to affectively do our jobs. The overwhelming majority of issues we have is rooted in not having adequate staff. Not enough people to cover shifts, so if someone is feeling unwell or has something come up they are still forced to come in. No flexibility in the shifts we can chose from. When on shift we let down guests because we simply cannot be in enough places or doing enough things at once.   We need more staff and we need more flexibility in scheduling. This will also increase moral because employees wont feel so overworked, which most do. Especially those who are not in management. Management seems to be able to take whatever time they like off and work whatever hours they please while everyone else is held to a different, stricter standard.",need more staff to make sure no staff will stayback because some of outlet they didn't paid over time claim,"We are royally understaffed.  During our daily mid-day rushes, at the front desk, sometimes you cannot see the end of the line and guests tell us that they have been waiting in line for 40mins to an hour.  Our SALT scores are  high because we staff 5,6, and 7 GSAs on Honors side to every 2 on the non-Honors side but these are guests too and they should not be discarded just because they probably won't fill out a servey.  The true value of our property is how we treat all guests not just the ones to fill out the survey.  The front staff can't keep up with these lines so they call out the back office people, which would normally not be a problem except they call them out so often that these people struggle to finish their jobs.  We need more staffing to help us get done what we need to without making guests wait for an hour in line.  All departments are struggling.  Our company culture needs to provide for better staffing to do our jobs.",2137

I noticed that the changing room and toilet facilities are only cleaned once a day. The peak hours are after our shift, mainly after 5pm when HSK/kitchen/F&B leaves work. I recommend to have someone scheduled again after 6pm to maintain a clean environment down there.

food and beverage,_VersionCH, Hotel,7.8226552117,4.86140332445e-09,249,2908,"There needs to be more manager coverage, especially in the food and beverage department, which will allow the F&B team not to get burnt out and to mitigate high turnover.","A stronger presence of other staff (Sales/Catering, Director of Food and Beverage) would be welcome so that they have a deeper understanding about what exactly a typical day is like for us and can fill in easily where needed on days we may be understaffed or just need an extra set of hands. Particularly the Director of F&B should have more of a presence during the day and not just during Breakfast hours; it would be nice if they were around more during the evenings and actually could fill in as Server, Bartender, Captain, Banquet Manager; and not just in a kitchen position. And in some ways that is true on Weekends for Sales and Catering staff; it would be nice to see them around for their functions on the weekends if it is necessary or just to check in with the group and make sure no issues arise with their event. Whether that is achieved through cross training or shadowing of some sort (which would be the most beneficial way to learn) or just a stronger and more willing presence to help us and their clients, even it it goes outside of their allotted hours.","Lack of practical training for new team member, as the result, the burden or work load is delegated unfairly to other team member. Lack of recognition for some of the team member, sometime other team member did not get any food as no proper food for them. There is no clear job delegation between guest service role and food beverage department like delivering amenities which actually is GSA job role but it given to F&B department. Lack of communication tools between kitchen and front office, like radio for kitchen staff so effective communication would be achieve within these two department, for example, executive lounge need more food can order through the radio straight away to the chef. If those area can be improved would be great for the work environment.",3157
